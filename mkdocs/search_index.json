            "text": "Requirements\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIXP Manager tries to stay current in terms of technology. Typically, this means some element of framework refresh(es) every couple of years and other more incremental package upgrades with minor version upgrades. As well as the obvious reasons for this, there is also the requirement to prevent developer apathy - insisting on legacy frameworks and packages that have been EOL'd provides a major stumbling block for bringing on new developers and contributors.\n\n\nThe current requirements for the web application are:\n\n\n\n\na Linux / BSD host.\n\n\nMariaDB / MySQL version 5.5.4 or later.\n\n\nApache / Nginx / etc.\n\n\nPHP \n= 7.0. \nNote that IXP Manager will not run on older versions of PHP.\n\n\nMemcached - optional but highly recommended.\n\n\n\n\nTo complete the installation using the included config/scripts, you will also need to have installed:\n\n\n\n\ngit - distributed revision control system (e.g.: \napt-get install git\n)\n\n\nmemcache extension module for PHP (e.g.: \napt-get install php-memcached\n)\n\n\nSNMP extension module for PHP (e.g.: \napt-get install php7.0-snmp\n)\n\n\nphp7.0-mbstring - may be built into the PHP core\n\n\nphp7.0-xml\n\n\nphp7.0-intl\n\n\nphp7.0-mysql\n\n\nphp7.0-mcrypt\n\n\nphp-ds\n\n\nphp-rrd\n\n\n\n\nFor completeness, the IXP Manager installation script for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installs:\n\n\napt-get install apache2 php7.0 php7.0-intl php7.0-mysql php-rrd php7.0-cgi php7.0-cli  \n\\\n\n    php7.0-snmp php7.0-curl php7.0-mcrypt php-memcached libapache2-mod-php7.0          \n\\\n\n    mysql-server mysql-client php-mysql memcached snmp nodejs nodejs-legacy npm        \n\\\n\n    php7.0-mbstring php7.0-xml php-gettext php-ds php-gd bgpq3 php-memcache unzip      \n\\\n\n    php-zip git\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IXP Manager Source\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe code for IXP Manager is maintained on GitHub and the canonical repository is \ninex/IXP-Manager\n.\n\n\nLog into the server where you wish to install IXP Manager. Move to the directory where you wish to store the source (our examples use \n/srv/ixpmanager\n which we refer to as \n$IXPROOT\n). Note that it \nshould not\n be checked out into any web exposed directory (e.g. do not checkout to \n/var/www\n).\n\n\nIXPROOT\n=\n/srv/ixpmanager\n\ncd\n /srv\ngit clone https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager.git ixpmanager\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n   \n# /srv/ixpmanager\n\ngit checkout master\nchown -R www-data: \n$IXPROOT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Composer and Bower\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIXP Manager uses \nComposer\n to manage its PHP dependencies. First, download a copy of the composer.phar. Once you have the PHAR archive, you can either keep it in your local project directory or move to \n/usr/local/bin\n to use it globally on your system.\n\n\nThe installation script for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installs these via:\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\n\nEXPECTED_SIGNATURE\n=\n$(\nwget https://composer.github.io/installer.sig -O - -q\n)\n\nphp -r \ncopy(\nhttps://getcomposer.org/installer\n, \ncomposer-setup.php\n);\n\n\nACTUAL_SIGNATURE\n=\n$(\nphp -r \necho hash_file(\nSHA384\n, \ncomposer-setup.php\n);\n)\n\n\n\nif\n \n[\n \n$EXPECTED_SIGNATURE\n \n=\n \n$ACTUAL_SIGNATURE\n \n]\n;\n \nthen\n\n    sudo -u www-data bash -c \nHOME=\n$IXPROOT\n \n cd \n$IXPROOT\n \n php composer-setup.php --quiet\n\n    rm \n$IXPROOT\n/composer-setup.php\n    \n# optional:\n\n    mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer\n\nelse\n\n    \necho\n -e \n\\n\\nERROR: Invalid installer signature for composer installation\n\n    rm \n$IXPROOT\n/composer-setup.php\n    \nexit\n 1\n\nfi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand:\n\n\nnpm install -g bower\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Setup and Dependancies\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDependencies\n\uf0c1\n\n\nInstall the required PHP libraries and frontend CSS/JS packages:\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\ncomposer install\nbower install\ncp .env.example .env\nphp artisan key:generate\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Setup\n\uf0c1\n\n\nUse whatever means you like to create a database and user for IXP Manager. For example:\n\n\nCREATE\n \nDATABASE\n \n`ixp`\n \nCHARACTER\n \nSET\n \n=\n \nutf8mb4\n \nCOLLATE\n \n=\n \nutf8mb4_unicode_ci\n;\n\n\nGRANT\n \nALL\n \nON\n \n`ixp`\n.\n*\n \nTO\n \n`ixp`\n@\n`localhost`\n \nIDENTIFIED\n \nBY\n \npick a password!\n;\n\n\nFLUSH\n \nPRIVILEGES\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen edit \n$IXPROOT/.env\n and set the database options:\n\n\nDB_HOST=localhost\nDB_DATABASE=ixp\nDB_USERNAME=ixp\nDB_PASSWORD=password\n\n\n\n\n\nNow create the database schema:\n\n\nphp artisan doctrine:schema:create\n\n\n\n\n\nSome older scripts still rely on MySQL view tables. Create these with:\n\n\nmysql -u ixp -p ixp \n \n$IXPROOT\n/tools/sql/views.sql\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEdit \n$IXPROOT/.env\n and review and set/change all parameters.

Typically, this means some element of framework refresh(es) every couple of years and other more incremental package upgrades with minor version upgrades. As well as the obvious reasons for this, there is also the requirement to prevent developer apathy - insisting on legacy frameworks and packages that have been EOL'd provides a major stumbling block for bringing on new developers and contributors.  The current requirements for the web application are:   a Linux / BSD host.  MariaDB / MySQL version 5.5.4 or later.  Apache / Nginx / etc.  PHP  = 7.0.  Note that IXP Manager will not run on older versions of PHP.  Memcached - optional but highly recommended.   To complete the installation using the included config/scripts, you will also need to have installed:   git - distributed revision control system (e.g.:  apt-get install git )  memcache extension module for PHP (e.g.:  apt-get install php-memcached )  SNMP extension module for PHP (e.g.:  apt-get install php7.0-snmp )  php7.0-mbstring - may be built into the PHP core  php7.0-xml  php7.0-intl  php7.0-mysql  php7.0-mcrypt  php-ds  php-rrd   For completeness, the IXP Manager installation script for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installs:  apt-get install apache2 php7.0 php7.0-intl php7.0-mysql php-rrd php7.0-cgi php7.0-cli   \\ \n    php7.0-snmp php7.0-curl php7.0-mcrypt php-memcached libapache2-mod-php7.0           \\ \n    mysql-server mysql-client php-mysql memcached snmp nodejs nodejs-legacy npm         \\ \n    php7.0-mbstring php7.0-xml php-gettext php-ds php-gd bgpq3 php-memcache unzip       \\ \n    php-zip git",

Note that the release notes for each version may contain specific upgrade instructions including schema changes.\n\n\nIf you have missed some versions, the most sensible approach is to upgrade to each minor release in sequence (4.5.0 -\n 4.6.0 -\n 4.7.0 -\n ...) and then to the latest patch version in the latest minor version.\n\n\nIn the below, we assume the following installation directory - alter this to suit your own situation:\n\n\nIXPROOT=/srv/ixpmanager\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general process is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable maintenance mode:\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\n./artisan down\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Git, checkout the next minor / latest patch version up from yours. For IXP Manager v4.\n\n\n# move to the directory where you have installed IXP Manager\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\n\n# pull the latest code\n\ngit pull\n\n# git checkout v4.x.y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall latest required libraries from composer (see notes below):\n\n\ncomposer install\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall latest frontend dependencies (see notes below):\n\n\n# if asked to chose a jquery version, chose the latest / highest version offered\n\nbower install\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart Memcached and clear the cache. Do not forget / skip this step!\n\n\nsystemctl restart memcached.service\n./artisan cache:clear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the database schema:\n\n\n# review / sanity check first:\n\n./artisan doctrine:schema:update --sql\n\n# If in doubt, take a mysqldump of your database first.\n\n\n# migrate:\n\n./artisan doctrine:schema:update --force\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestart Memcached (yes, again). Do not forget / skip this step!\n\n\nsystemctl restart memcached.service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure there are no version specific changes required in the release notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable maintenance mode:\n\n\n./artisan up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Bower Dependancies\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIt is not advisable to run bower are root but how you run it will depend on your own installation.\n\n\nIf you installed IXP Manager via the \ninstallation scripts\n, then it will have changed ownership on directories that the web server does not need to write to to root.\n\n\nThe following options would work on Ubuntu (as root):\n\n\n# set this to your IXP Manager installation directory\n\n\nIXPHOME\n=\n/srv/ixpmanager\n\n\n# update bower\n\nsudo -u www-data bash -c \nHOME=\n${\nIXPHOME\n}\n/storage \n cd \n${\nIXPHOME\n}\n \n bower --config.interactive=false -f update\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above command is structured as it is because typically the \nwww-data\n user has a nologin shell specified.\n\n\nYour mileage may vary on this and we're happy to accept pull requests with other options.\n\n\nUpdating Composer Dependancies\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis is similar to the bower section above so please read that if you have not already.\n\n\nThe following options would work on Ubuntu (as root):\n\n\n# set this to your IXP Manager installation directory\n\n\nIXPHOME\n=\n/srv/ixpmanager\n\n\n# update bower\n\nsudo -u www-data bash -c \nHOME=\n${\nIXPHOME\n}\n/storage \n cd \n${\nIXPHOME\n}\n \n composer install\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrecting Database Issues / Verifying Your Schema\n\uf0c1\n\n\nBecause of the manual process of database updates, it is possible your database schema may fall out of sync.\n\n\nIf you are having issues, first and foremost, restart Memcached.

As such, all the older configuration options (from \napplication/configs/application.ini\n) need to be ported to \n.env\n.\n\n\nThe \nphp dotenv\n file (\n.env\n) is where all the new configuration options go. These in turn are used by the configuration files under \nconfig/\n.\n\n\nNB: Where possible, place local changes into \n.env\n rather than changing the config files as these files are under version control. See \nLaravel's documentation on this\n and email the mailing list for help.\n\n\nOnce you have worked your way through \n.env\n, move into the \n$IXPROOT/config\n directory and - as appropriate for your own installation - examine each config file that ends in \n.dist\n. If you use / need any features in these files, copy then such as:\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n/config\ncp xxxx.php.dist xxxx.php\n\n\n\n\n\nThen edit the resultant \n.php\n file (or, better, where \nconfig()\n options exist, add them to \n.env\n).\n\n\nThese \n.dist\n files represent v3 funtionality that has not yet been fully ported to v4/Laravel.\n\n\nUpdate the Database Schema\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere's about 50 schema changed between the end of v3 and v4.4.\n\n\nView the required changes with:\n\n\n./artisan doctrine:schema:update --sql\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd apply with:\n\n\n./artisan doctrine:schema:update --force\n\n\n\n Note that this may take a few minutes if you have a lot of data such as BGP session data.\n\n\nMigrate Plaintext Passwords to Bcrypt\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSince v4.5, we \nno longer allow plaintext passwords\n. If you were using plaintext passwords, you need to convert them to bcrypt as follows:\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\n\n\n# dummy run to see what happens:\n\nphp artisan utils:convert-plaintext-password\n\n\n# really convert passwords and save to database:\n\nphp artisan utils:convert-plaintext-password --force\n\n\n\n\n\nStage One Complete\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou should be able to point Apache / your web server at the new IXP Manager installation and log in.\n\n\nMRTG Graphing Migration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWe've implemented a new graphing backend called \nGrapher\n. One of the changes is that the graphing directory structure and file-naming conventions have changed. Primarily, we've replaced non-static handles (such as database fields like \ncustomer.shortname\n, \nphysicalinterface.monitorindex\n and \nswitcher.name\n with immutable primary keys).\n\n\nAs such, you need to both rename the statistics directory structure and regenerate the configuration.\n\n\nIt is strongly recommended you copy your existing files and do this in parallel or, at least keep a backup.\n Also, stop the MRTG daemon before starting.\n\n\nPerforming the Migration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFirst, you'll need to update your local configuration in \n.env\n by setting something like:\n\n\nGRAPHER_BACKENDS=\nmrtg\n\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_LOGDIR=\n/path/to/new/mrtg/data\n\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_WORKDIR=\n/path/to/new/mrtg/data\n\nGRAPHER_CACHE_ENABLED=true\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the \nGrapher\n documentation for full details of what these mean.\n\n\nYou'll then need to migrate all your MRTG files to the new naming scheme. Run the commands below twice. Once to verify the output and a second time piped to sh (\n| sh\n) to actually execute the commands.\n\n\n# set a variable for what will become the \nold\n files for convenience\n\n\nOLDMRTG\n=\n/srv/old-mrtg\n\n\n# position ourselves in the IXP Manager root directory\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\n\n\n# stop mrtg\n\nservice mrtg stop  \n# or as appropriate for your platform\n\n\n\n# Migrate IXP graphs.\n\n\n#\n\n\n# In v3 of IXP Manager, the name of this was set by a database\n\n\n# parameter in the IXP table called \naggregate graph name\n.\n\n\n# You will be able to spot it in the old MRTG files where the\n\n\n# old IXP file is named something like: \nixp_peering-XXXXX-bits.log\n.\n\n\n# The \nXXXXXX\n bit is the aggregate name you need to replace in the below:\n\nphp artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L \n$OLDMRTG\n -X --agg-name\n=\nXXXXXX\nphp artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L \n$OLDMRTG\n -X --agg-name\n=\nXXXXXX \n|\n sh\n\n\n# Migrate infrastructure graphs.\n\n\n#\n\n\n# In v3 of IXP Manager, the name of this was set by a database\n\n\n# parameter in the infrastructure table called \naggregate graph name\n.\n\n\n# You will be able to spot it in the old MRTG files where the\n\n\n# old IXP file is named something like: \nixp_peering-XXXXX-bits.log\n.\n\n\n# The \nXXXXXX\n bit is the aggregate name you need to replace in the below:\n\nphp artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L \n$OLDMRTG\n -I\nphp artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L \n$OLDMRTG\n -I \n|\n sh\n\n\n# Migrate switch graphs\n\nphp artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L \n$OLDMRTG\n -S\nphp artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L \n$OLDMRTG\n -S \n|\n sh\n\n\n# Migrate trunk graphs and configuration.\n\n\n# If you had not configured trunk graphs you can skip this.

IXP Manager v4 does not use this but pulls the required RRD files directly.\n\n\nIf you have this on the same server or can expose it using NFS for example, then set the path accordingly in \n.env\n:\n\n\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_SFLOW_ROOT=\n/srv/ixpmatrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have implemented this via a web server on the sflow server (as we typically do at INEX), then you need to expose the RRD data directory to IXP Manager using an Apache config such as:\n\n\nAlias /grapher-sflow /srv/ixpmatrix\n\n\nDirectory \n/srv/ixpmatrix\n\n    Options None\n    AllowOverride None\n    \nRequireAny\n\n            Require ip 192.0.2.0/24\n            Require ip 2001:db8::/32\n    \n/RequireAny\n\n\n/Directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand update \n.env\n for this with something like:\n\n\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_SFLOW_ROOT=\nhttp://www.example.com/grapher-sflow",

            "text": "Customer Interfaces\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis section explains how to set up a customer interface.\n\n\nDatabase Overview\n\uf0c1\n\n\nTo fully understand how IXP Manager treats customer interfaces, you need a little background on the database schema. This will also help explain why we have laid out the UI as it is.\n\n\nThe original database schema dates from pre-2005 and has stood the test of time extremely well.\n\n\n\n\nThe above is described as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCustomers have a 1:n relationship with virtual interfaces (VI). A VI is a container object that represents a customer connection and all the elements that make up that connection.\n\n\nVIs have a 1:n relationship with physical interfaces (PI).\n\n\nA physical interface in turn has a 1:1 relationship with switch ports (SP).\n\n\nPIs represent what we say the customer has (e.g. a 1Gb port). The SP has information from the switch itself and can help identify inconsistencies with what was expected to be configured/billed and what has actually been provisioned).\n\n\nPIs can also move between SPs (e.g. customer upgrades / switch replacements / etc.).\n\n\nBy schematically representing PIs and SPs as different entities, we can associate elements such as usage graphs to the PI so these remain consistent when a SP changes.\n\n\nAdding a second (or more) PI to a VI indicates that the port is a LAG.\n\n\nVIs have a 1:n relationship with VLAN interfaces (VLI). You can consider the PI element the layer2 / physical element and the VLI element the layer3 element.\n\n\nA VLI has a 1:1 mapping with a VLAN (typically the peering LAN).\n\n\nIf IPv4 is enabled, the VLI has a 1:1 mapping to an IPv4 address from the given VLAN.\n\n\nIf IPv6 is enabled, the VLI has a 1:1 mapping to an IPv6 address from the given VLAN.\n\n\nThe VLI also indicates if this interface should have a route server peering session, MD5 passwords, etc. (all explained below).\n\n\n\n\nProvisioning an Interface via the Wizard\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe best way to provision a new interface for a customer is to use the wizard. This can be accessed from the customer's overview page via a menu on the top right:\n\n\n\n\nWhen you open the wizard, you will see:\n\n\n\n\nThis can be used to provision a single port standard customer connection. If they customer needs a LAG or other non-standard options, these can be added afterwards.\n\n\nGeneral Interface Settings\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe customer should be prefilled and read-only as you enter the wizard from a specific customer overview page.\n\n\nYou would normally just select your main / primary peering VLAN from the \nVLAN\n dropdown. There are some notable exceptions:\n\n\n\n\nyou may have more than one peering LAN. For example, INEX runs two resilient peering networks in Dublin and a separate regional exchange called INEX Cork. These are all unique VLANs.\n\n\nif you are provisioning a port dedicated to a private VLAN, you would just select that VLAN but leave \nIPv4 Enabled\n and \nIPv6 Enabled\n unchecked as IP addressing on private VLANs in not within an IX's purview.\n\n\nat INEX we also have quarantine VLANs for each peering VLAN. You would \ntypically\n not select a quarantine VLAN here during provisioning unless you are using automation. Just put the interface in the primary peering LAN and let the \nPhysical Interface Settings\n (see below) look after the quarantine flag.\n\n\nYou should check the \nUse 802.1q framing\n checkbox if the port should be tagged facing the customer. If you are not using any automation tools, this will be informational for you rather than production affecting.\n\n\nChecking either or both of \nIPv4 Enabled\n and \nIPv6 Enabled\n will show the \nIPv4 Details\n and \nIPv6 Details\n (as per the above image) and enable these protocols for the customer's connection.\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Interface Settings\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis section allows you to select the physical interface / switch port for the connection.\n\n\n\n\nSwitch\n: a dropdown list of all switches. Be careful as at present this list is all active switches rather than switches on the same infrastructure as the selected VLAN from \nGeneral Interface Settings\n.\n\n\nPort\n: the switch port to use. This is dynamically populated when the switch is selected and \nwill only show ports of type \nPeering\n or type \nUnset / Unknown\n (these are set on a per port basis when adding / editing switches).\n\n\n\n\nStatus\n: the port status currently has one of five options. They effectively work as a boolean where \nConnected\n means on/enabled and the rest mean disabled as explained below. In practice, we tend to just use three states:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnected\n: this is the most important. When a \nvirtual interface\n has \nany\n port with the \nConnected\n state, then IXP Manager will consider this connection active and will generate router configuration, monitoring configuration, etc.\n\n\n\n\nAwaiting X-Connect\n: the customer has requested an upgrade / new port and we are awaiting for the co-location provider / customer to get the cross connect organised.\n\n\nQuarantine\n: the port is connected and is under going quarantine prior to being moved onto the production peering LAN. During quarantine, INEX checks the port to ensure only ARP, IPv4 and IPv6 packets are received (no *-discovery, STP, etc. as well as a number of other things).\n\n\n\n\nThe \nNot Connected\n and \nDisabled\n states have the same effect as (2) and (3) above and can be used as informational settings where (2) and (3) do not apply.\n\n\nSpeed and duplex are self explanatory. These settings in the \nphysical interface\n entity are informational unless you are doing automation. They also have knock on effects to (for example) graphing - where the MRTG max value on an interface is set to this to prevent weird excessive spikes on counter rollovers.\n\n\nGeneral VLAN Settings\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThese settings apply to the VLAN interface.\n\n\nThe \nMax BGP Prefixes\n is a setting used to determine max prefixes on router BGP peers - please \nsee the global version of this as explained in the customer section for details\n.\n\n\nIf \nApply IRRDB Filtering\n is \nnot\n set, then the route servers will accept any prefixes advertised by the customer (note that the default templates will filter martians and apply a max prefix limit). Generally speaking this is a \nvery bad idea\n and should only be used in exceptional cases. \nINEX never uses this setting - but demand from other IX's had it added.\n\n\nMulticast Enabled\n is informational only. INEX used to support multicast on the peering LAN but removed support in 2015 due to lack of interest and added complexity / cost when purchasing new switches.\n\n\nIf \nRoute Server Client\n is checked, then IXP Manager will configure a BGP peer for this connection when generating \nroute server configurations\n. It is also used in other areas to show if a member uses the route servers or not, by the \nPeering Manager\n to calculate missing BGP sessions, etc.\n\n\nSimilarly, if \nAS112 Client\n is checked, then IXP Manager will configure a BGP peer for this connection when generating \nAS112 router configurations\n.\n\n\nIPv4/IPv6 Details\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWhen \nIPv4 / IPv6 Enabled\n is checked under \nGeneral Interface Settings\n above, these two sections will be available.\n\n\nThe same details apply to IPv4 and IPv6 options so we will document them together.\n\n\n\n\nIP Address\n: the IP address to assign to this customer. This is taken from \navailable\n IP addresses for the VLAN selected in \nGeneral Interface Settings\n.\n\n\nIP addresses are added in IXP Manager via the left hand menu under IXP Admin Actions.\n\n\nThe dropdown also works as an input field - this allows you to enter a new IP address that does not already exist in the field. When the wizard form is submitted, the address is added and associated with the VLAN. This is most useful for the IPv6 field if you are using a non-sequential numbering plan.\n\n\nHostname\n: if you use IXP Manager to configure your \nDNS ARPA\n entries, the hostname entered here will be returned when a PTR request is made for the assigned IP address. Enter a complete hostname without trailing period such as: \nwww.example.com\n.\n\n\nBGP MD5 Secret\n: The will be used for \ngenerating router configurations\n.\n\n\nThe \ncircle refresh\n icon in the IPv4 section will generate a cryptographically secure secret in modern browsers.\n\n\nThe \nsquare refresh\n icon in the IPv6 section will copy the value from the IPv4 section.\n\n\nNote that setting a MD5 here does not mean that all router configurations have to include it. MD5 can be disabled entirely by a \nrouters configuration\n or by templating.\n\n\nCan Ping\n: IXP Manager generates configuration for a number of other tools such as \nSmokeping\n and Nagios which ping customer routers. These are invaluable tools for problem solving, monitoring and graphing long term trends. We enable this by default unless a customer specifically asks us not to.\n\n\nCan Monitor RC BGP\n: this is more of a legacy option for configuration builders that used to check for established route collector BGP sessions and warn if not present. This is deprecated and will be removed.\n\n\n\n\nViewing / Editing an Interface\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOnce an interface has been added as per the above wizard instructions, you can view and edit the interface by selecting the edit icon against the connection you are interested in from the \nPorts\n tab on the customer overview page. When you do that, you will see a screen such as the following:\n\n\n\n\nYou can see from the layout of this screen how it ties in with the schema explained above.\n\n\nVirtual Interface Details\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe screenshot above shows the virtual interface details with the \nAdvanced Options\n shown. The additional fields here that were not in the wizard are described below.\n\n\nLink aggregation / LAG framing\n is mostly informational unless you are doing automation. There are some restrictions. Namely / specifically:\n\n\n\n\nif you have more than one physical interface, it will require you to set this.\n\n\nfor a single interface, checking this indicates you want LACP on a single member LAG. This is useful and often common practice as it allows upgrades without outages.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nVirtual Interface Name\n is again mostly informational unless you are doing automation. It should be the start of the LAG name without the number. On an IOS device this would be \nPort-channel\n for example. Matched with this is the \nChannel Group Number\n with is tacked onto the end of the \nVirtual Interface Name\n. Leave it as 0 and when you check \nLink aggregation / LAG framing\n and save the changes, IXP Manager will set this to the next available unused port channel / bundle / LAG number on that switch.\n\n\nBoth \nDescription\n and \nMTU\n are informational.\n\n\nPhysical Interfaces\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou can add additional physical interfaces to a connection / virtual interface. This effectivily means you are creating a LAG. The form for adding additional physical interfaces is indentical to that in the wizard.\n\n\nVLAN Interfaces\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe most common use case of more than one VLAN Interface is when your customer may also have private VLANs on their connection.\n\n\nOther than that, the VLAN interface add / edit form has all the same elements as the wizard with one addition:\n\n\n\n\nBusy host\n: this flag indicates that the customer's router is unusually slow to reply to ICMP echo requests and that when monitoring, the configuraiton should allow for warnings after a 5sec RTT rather than 1sec.",

This will also help explain why we have laid out the UI as it is.  The original database schema dates from pre-2005 and has stood the test of time extremely well.   The above is described as follows:   Customers have a 1:n relationship with virtual interfaces (VI). A VI is a container object that represents a customer connection and all the elements that make up that connection.  VIs have a 1:n relationship with physical interfaces (PI).  A physical interface in turn has a 1:1 relationship with switch ports (SP).  PIs represent what we say the customer has (e.g. a 1Gb port). The SP has information from the switch itself and can help identify inconsistencies with what was expected to be configured/billed and what has actually been provisioned).  PIs can also move between SPs (e.g. customer upgrades / switch replacements / etc.).  By schematically representing PIs and SPs as different entities, we can associate elements such as usage graphs to the PI so these remain consistent when a SP changes.  Adding a second (or more) PI to a VI indicates that the port is a LAG.  VIs have a 1:n relationship with VLAN interfaces (VLI). You can consider the PI element the layer2 / physical element and the VLI element the layer3 element.  A VLI has a 1:1 mapping with a VLAN (typically the peering LAN).  If IPv4 is enabled, the VLI has a 1:1 mapping to an IPv4 address from the given VLAN.  If IPv6 is enabled, the VLI has a 1:1 mapping to an IPv6 address from the given VLAN.  The VLI also indicates if this interface should have a route server peering session, MD5 passwords, etc. (all explained below).",

These are all unique VLANs.  if you are provisioning a port dedicated to a private VLAN, you would just select that VLAN but leave  IPv4 Enabled  and  IPv6 Enabled  unchecked as IP addressing on private VLANs in not within an IX's purview.  at INEX we also have quarantine VLANs for each peering VLAN. You would  typically  not select a quarantine VLAN here during provisioning unless you are using automation. Just put the interface in the primary peering LAN and let the  Physical Interface Settings  (see below) look after the quarantine flag.  You should check the  Use 802.1q framing  checkbox if the port should be tagged facing the customer.

This is dynamically populated when the switch is selected and  will only show ports of type  Peering  or type  Unset / Unknown  (these are set on a per port basis when adding / editing switches).   Status : the port status currently has one of five options. They effectively work as a boolean where  Connected  means on/enabled and the rest mean disabled as explained below. In practice, we tend to just use three states:    Connected : this is the most important. When a  virtual interface  has  any  port with the  Connected  state, then IXP Manager will consider this connection active and will generate router configuration, monitoring configuration, etc.   Awaiting X-Connect : the customer has requested an upgrade / new port and we are awaiting for the co-location provider / customer to get the cross connect organised.  Quarantine : the port is connected and is under going quarantine prior to being moved onto the production peering LAN. During quarantine, INEX checks the port to ensure only ARP, IPv4 and IPv6 packets are received (no *-discovery, STP, etc. as well as a number of other things).   The  Not Connected  and  Disabled  states have the same effect as (2) and (3) above and can be used as informational settings where (2) and (3) do not apply.  Speed and duplex are self explanatory.

            "text": "Patch Panels / Cross Connects\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOne of the more difficult things for an IXP to manage is the sheer volume of patch panels / cross connects they need to manage. We have approached the issue a number of times in IXP Manger but abandoned the attempt every time. Typically our original solutions were over-engineered where all we really needed was something which could replace a spreadsheet per panel.\n\n\nWe believe we have now developed a feature complete and useful means of managing patch panels and associated cross connects.\n\n\nFeatures\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nAdd / edit patch panels  (which includes cable and connector types).\n\n\nList associated patch panel ports which includes:\n\n\ntheir state (such as available / prewired, awaiting cross connect, connected, awaiting cease, reserved, broken).\n\n\nassociated customer and/or switchport.\n\n\nco-location provider's circuit reference.\n\n\ninternal ticket references.\n\n\nTransition ports from available / prewired to awaiting x-connect to connected to awaiting cease to ceased and then available again.\n\n\nCustomer view of their cross connects.\n\n\nPublic (visible to customers) and private notes per cross connect.\n\n\nAttach public and private files to cross connects (such as test results, completion documents, order forms, etc).\n\n\nMaintain complete history of a patch panel port.\n\n\nGenerate and email LoAs (as PDF) with a URL verification function for co-location providers.\n\n\nGenerate emails for connection and cease requests as well as an email providing full customer view of a cross connect.\n\n\nTypically fibre ports are \nduplex\n ports but there is a growing use of BiDi optics meaning simplex ports. Our implementation treats all ports as simplex but you can mark it as duplex and set its partner port.\n\n\n\n\nDuplex Fibre Ports\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWe suggest adding fibre ports as two ports per duplex port. I.e. if your patch panel has 12 duplex ports, enter this as 24 ports. When allocating ports later, you can set it as a duplex port and select its \npartner / slave port\n. This will future proof your patch panels for the growing use of bidi optics and other simplex based xWDM fibre solutions.\n\n\nFrom our experience, duplex fibre ports are often identified as their individual strands. For example, \nduplex port 5\n would be referenced as \nF9/F10\n.\n\n\nYour mileage may vary on this but we need to allow this flexibility to cover both use-cases. You always have options however:\n\n\n\n\nyou can change the presentation of how these ports are referenced externally by \nskinning\n the templates.\n\n\nyou have the option to edit emails before they are sent to also present this as you wish.\n\n\nyou can chose to treat duplex ports as single ports rather than doubling them up.\n\n\nwhen you have duplex ports on a patch panel, IXP Manager will provide a duplex view by default with a CSS-based toggle to reveal the typical partner ports.\n\n\nif you think IXP Manager can make this easier, please talk to us. \nBut we cannot cover every use case programatically. We've opted to allow flexibility rather than dictate a particular format.\n\n\n\n\nAdding a Patch Panel\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe following image shows a typical \nadd a new patch panel\n form (as of v4.3). You'll note that clicking \nHelp\n provides detailed context aware help messages.\n\n\n\n\nMost of this is self-explanatory but:\n\n\n\n\nBy default, we set the \nColocation Reference\n to the \nPatch Panel Name\n. We are not sure it's a good idea for IXPs to create a second name different to the co-location provider's but this option is available to you. \nSeriously, think about what you are doing here - more references means more confusion!\n The cabinet and cable type is displayed in the list of patch panels so even with obscure data centre references, it should be easy to find what you need.\n\n\nLocation Notes\n: Data centre / co-location providers do a lot of weird, wonderful and strange things! They provide multiple references for a single patch panel (IXP cabinet, MMR, etc.), they get taken over and re-reference everything or even provide no discernable reference. The field is a freetext field that will be included (and parsed as Markdown) in all emails generated by IXP Manager to help you help them identify a patch panel!\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to that, we will also use a cabinets \nU's are counted from top/bottom\n, and a patch panel's \nU position\n and \nmounted at front/rear\n to also create a location description.\n\n When setting the \nNumber of Ports\n, ensure you count duplex fibre ports as \ntwo ports\n. So 12 duplex fibre ports would be entered as 24. When editing a patch panel, this input field represents the number of additional ports you want to add to a patch panel and thus defaults to 0 in that situation.\n\n \nPort Name Prefix\n: This is an optional field intended for use on fibre patch panels. As an example, you may wish to prefix individual fibre strands in a duplex port with F which would mean the name of a duplex port would be displayed as F1/F2.\n* \nChargeable\n: Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. Setting this only sets the default option when allocating ports to members later. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other.\n\n\nFiltering Patch Panel Ports\n\uf0c1\n\n\nQuite often, all you are looking for is a free in a particular location (data centre) or cabinet of a particular cable type (UTP / SMF / etc.).\n\n\nIXP Manager makes this easy from the \nPatch Panels\n page via the top right button labeled \nFilter Options\n. When clicked, this yields an advanced search as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCabinets auto-fills when you chose (or change) a location.\n\n\nPatch Panel Port States\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA patch panel port can have the following states:\n\n\n\n\nAvailable\n: The port is free and available for use.\n\n\nPrewired\n: This is equivalent to available but it means the port is prewired to a given switchport (you set the port when setting the prewired status). This is useful for IXPs that prewire a bunch of ports to avoid remote hands costs / data centre visits.\n\n\nAwaiting Xconnect\n: Port has been assigned to a member and we are awaiting the co-location provider to install the cross connect. In this state, context aware actions such as emailing connection requests, LoA generation and \nSet Connected\n are all available.\n\n\nConnected\n: Connected and in use.\n\n\nAwaiting Cease\n: This connection is no longer required and we are awaiting the end user / co-location provider to cease the connection.\n\n\nCeased\n: You will never see a ceased state. When a cross connect is marked as ceased, it's current state is archived (for history, include files) and the port is reset to \nAvailable\n. We do not revert to \nPrewired\n but an information message is shown to the user to hint this.\n\n\nReserved\n: Useful to mark particular ports as \noff limits\n for whatever reason.\n\n\nBroken\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\nFree / Available Ports\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIXP Manager will colour ports in the \nAvailable\n, \nPrewired\n and \nAwaiting Cease\n states are green allowing an easy visual indication of available ports.\n\n\nPatch Panel Port Lifecycle\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPatch panel ports start as either \navailable\n or \nprewired\n. The context menu in these states is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnset Prewired\n is available as this port has a \nPrewired\n status. Clicking this reverts it to plain \nAvailable\n and disassociates it from the prewired port.\n\n\nEdit Note...\n is always available and provides a pop up to edit public and private notes associated with the port (current lifecycle - ceased ports have their notes at that time archived and cleared).\n\n\n\n\nThe main lifecycle option here is \nAllocate\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n: A one line short description to be shown in the list of patch panel ports. Just enough to help explain the ports purpose. Detailed information should be placed in the notes section. Can also be used to explain a reserved / broken / other port. Note that this is parsed as Markdown. \nNB:\n A description is discouraged for customer ports connected to a switch. The customer name and switch port are the description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColocation Circuit Reference\n: this is the reference provided by the colocation provider to uniquely reference this cross connect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTicket Reference(s)\n: This is a free text field to be used by IXPs as they wish. The intended use is to enter helpdesk ticket references that relate to this cross connect order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuplex connection?\n: Clicking this allows you to select the slave port for duplex connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch / Switch Port\n / \nCustomer\n: You have a number of options when allocating a port:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the port is pre-wired then the switch / switch port will be set here.\n\n\n\n\nIf you chose a switch port which has been allocated to a customer, then this patch panel port will also be allocated to that customer. The backend logic will detect if this is the case and update the customer field.\n\n\nConversely, if you chose a customer first, the switch / switch port dropdowns will be populated with only that customer's assigned ports.\n\n\nSometimes you will get cross connects that are not intended to be connected to peering switches (e.g. connections to co-located customer equipment, IXP metro connections, etc.). In these cases, just select the customer (and if it's the IXP itself, select the IXP customer) and leave switch / switch port unselected.\n\n\n\n\nIf you need to reset these fields, just click either of the Reset button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatch Panel Port Status\n: when allocating a port, this will allow you to set the state to \nAwaiting Xconnect\n or \nConnected\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Interface Status\n: this is not depicted above. If the selected switch port has already been assigned to a customer by way of a physical interface, you will have the option to update this here also.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic\n and \nPrivate Notes\n: Public notes are available to the customer. Both fields are interpreted as Markdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChargeable\n: Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other. How individual IXPs use this is up to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Use\n: Marks the port as used by the IXP itself. E.g. metro connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwned By\n: Useful indication for billing and cease requests. Should represent the contractural owner of the cross connect. One of: Customer, IXP, Service Provider, Data Centre, Other. \nService Provider\n might be a metro provider where they ordered the cross connect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce a port is allocated, it enters the \nAwaiting XConnect\n / \nConnected\n state and there are additional context menu options available:\n\n\n\n\nThe three lifecycle actions are:\n\n\n\n\nSet Connected\n: updates the status (and allows you to add public/private notes). You next action after this should be \nEmail - Connect\n.\n\n\nSet Awaiting Cease\n: mark the port and pending disconnection. Your next action after this should be \nEmail - Cease\n.\n\n\nSet Ceased\n: this is a \ntransitive state\n in that it doesn't \nstick\n.

From our experience, duplex fibre ports are often identified as their individual strands. For example,  duplex port 5  would be referenced as  F9/F10 .  Your mileage may vary on this but we need to allow this flexibility to cover both use-cases. You always have options however:   you can change the presentation of how these ports are referenced externally by  skinning  the templates.  you have the option to edit emails before they are sent to also present this as you wish.  you can chose to treat duplex ports as single ports rather than doubling them up.  when you have duplex ports on a patch panel, IXP Manager will provide a duplex view by default with a CSS-based toggle to reveal the typical partner ports.  if you think IXP Manager can make this easier, please talk to us.

Most of this is self-explanatory but:   By default, we set the  Colocation Reference  to the  Patch Panel Name . We are not sure it's a good idea for IXPs to create a second name different to the co-location provider's but this option is available to you.  Seriously, think about what you are doing here - more references means more confusion!  The cabinet and cable type is displayed in the list of patch panels so even with obscure data centre references, it should be easy to find what you need.  Location Notes : Data centre / co-location providers do a lot of weird, wonderful and strange things! They provide multiple references for a single patch panel (IXP cabinet, MMR, etc.), they get taken over and re-reference everything or even provide no discernable reference. The field is a freetext field that will be included (and parsed as Markdown) in all emails generated by IXP Manager to help you help them identify a patch panel!   In addition to that, we will also use a cabinets  U's are counted from top/bottom , and a patch panel's  U position  and  mounted at front/rear  to also create a location description.  When setting the  Number of Ports , ensure you count duplex fibre ports as  two ports . So 12 duplex fibre ports would be entered as 24. When editing a patch panel, this input field represents the number of additional ports you want to add to a patch panel and thus defaults to 0 in that situation.   Port Name Prefix : This is an optional field intended for use on fibre patch panels. As an example, you may wish to prefix individual fibre strands in a duplex port with F which would mean the name of a duplex port would be displayed as F1/F2.\n*  Chargeable : Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that.

Edit Note...  is always available and provides a pop up to edit public and private notes associated with the port (current lifecycle - ceased ports have their notes at that time archived and cleared).   The main lifecycle option here is  Allocate :     Description : A one line short description to be shown in the list of patch panel ports. Just enough to help explain the ports purpose. Detailed information should be placed in the notes section. Can also be used to explain a reserved / broken / other port. Note that this is parsed as Markdown.  NB:  A description is discouraged for customer ports connected to a switch. The customer name and switch port are the description.    Colocation Circuit Reference : this is the reference provided by the colocation provider to uniquely reference this cross connect.    Ticket Reference(s) : This is a free text field to be used by IXPs as they wish. The intended use is to enter helpdesk ticket references that relate to this cross connect order.    Duplex connection? : Clicking this allows you to select the slave port for duplex connections.    Switch / Switch Port  /  Customer : You have a number of options when allocating a port:    If the port is pre-wired then the switch / switch port will be set here.   If you chose a switch port which has been allocated to a customer, then this patch panel port will also be allocated to that customer. The backend logic will detect if this is the case and update the customer field.  Conversely, if you chose a customer first, the switch / switch port dropdowns will be populated with only that customer's assigned ports.  Sometimes you will get cross connects that are not intended to be connected to peering switches (e.g. connections to co-located customer equipment, IXP metro connections, etc.). In these cases, just select the customer (and if it's the IXP itself, select the IXP customer) and leave switch / switch port unselected.   If you need to reset these fields, just click either of the Reset button.    Patch Panel Port Status : when allocating a port, this will allow you to set the state to  Awaiting Xconnect  or  Connected .    Physical Interface Status : this is not depicted above. If the selected switch port has already been assigned to a customer by way of a physical interface, you will have the option to update this here also.    Public  and  Private Notes : Public notes are available to the customer. Both fields are interpreted as Markdown.    Chargeable : Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other. How individual IXPs use this is up to them.    Internal Use : Marks the port as used by the IXP itself. E.g. metro connections.    Owned By : Useful indication for billing and cease requests. Should represent the contractural owner of the cross connect. One of: Customer, IXP, Service Provider, Data Centre, Other.  Service Provider  might be a metro provider where they ordered the cross connect.    Once a port is allocated, it enters the  Awaiting XConnect  /  Connected  state and there are additional context menu options available:   The three lifecycle actions are:   Set Connected : updates the status (and allows you to add public/private notes).

These IP addresses can show up in traceroutes (for example) and both IXPs and customers like to have these resolve to a hostname.\n\n\nWhen creating \nVLAN Interfaces\n in IXP Manager there is a field called \nIPv[4/6] Hostname\n. This is intended for this DNS ARPA purpose. Some customers have specific requirements for these while other smaller customers may not fully understand the use cases.

Otherwise, you need an \nAPI key\n when using them in scripts.\n\n\nAs JSON\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou can use the \nIXP Manager\n API to get all ARPA entries for a given VLAN and protocol as a JSON object using the following endpoint format:\n\n\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/dns/arpa/{vlanid}/{protocol}\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\nvlanid\n is the database ID (\nDB ID\n) of the VLAN. You can find the DB ID in IXP Manager in the VLAN table (select \nVLANs\n from the left hand side menu).\n\n\nprotocol\n is either \n4\n for IPv4 or 6 for \nIPv6\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf either of these are invalid, the API will return with a HTTP 404 response.\n\n\nAnd example of the JSON response returned is:\n\n\n[\n\n    \n{\n\n        \nenabled\n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n        \naddress\n:\n \n192.0.2.67\n,\n\n        \nhostname\n:\n \ncherrie.example.com\n,\n\n        \narpa\n:\n \n67.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.\n\n    \n},\n\n    \n...\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\nenabled\n indicates if the protocol has been enabled for this user. This is nearly always true. A situation where it may be false is if you enabled IPv6 for a user; then that user subsequently decided to not use IPv6; then you unchecked the \nIPv6 Enabled\n box in the VLAN Interface form without removing address / hostname entries.\n\n\naddress\n - this IPv4/6 address of the VLAN interface as assigned by the IXP.\n\n\nhostname\n - the configured hostname for this address as entered into \nIXP Manager\n.\n\n\narpa\n: the generated ARPA record name for the IP address assigned by the IXP.\n\n\n\n\nYou can now feed the JSON object into a script to create your own DNS zones appropriate to your DNS infrastructure.\n\n\nWhen scripting, we would normally pull the JSON object using something like:\n\n\n#! /usr/bin/env bash\n\n\n\nKEY\n=\nyour-ixp-manager-api-key\n\n\nURL\n=\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/dns/arpa\n\n\nVLANIDS\n=\n1 2\n\n\nPROTOCOLS\n=\n4 6\n\n\n\nfor\n v in \n$VLANIDS\n;\n \ndo\n\n    \nfor\n p in \n$PROTOCOLS\n;\n \ndo\n\n\n        \ncmd\n=\n/usr/local/bin/curl --fail -s             \\\n\n\n            -H \\\nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: \n${\nKEY\n}\n\\\n       \\\n\n\n            \n${\nURL\n}\n/\n${\nv\n}\n/\n${\np\n}\n                           \\\n\n\n                \n/tmp/dns-arpa-vlanid\n$v\n-ipv\n$p\n.json.\n$$\n\n        \neval\n \n$cmd\n\n\n        \nif\n \n[[\n \n$?\n -ne \n0\n \n]]\n;\n \nthen\n\n            \necho\n \nERROR: non-zero return from DNS ARPA API call for vlan ID \n$v\n with protocol \n$p\n\n            \ncontinue\n\n        \nfi\n\n\n        // \ndo\n something\n\n        rm /tmp/dns-arpa-vlanid\n$v\n-ipv\n$p\n.json.\n$$\n\n    \ndone\n\n\ndone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Templates\n\uf0c1\n\n\nRather than writing your own scripts to consume the JSON object as above, it may be easier to use the bundled ISC Bind templates or to write your own template for IXP Manager.\n\n\nYou can use the \nIXP Manager\n API to get all ARPA entries for a given VLAN and protocol as plain text based on a template by using the following API endpoint:\n\n\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/dns/arpa/{vlanid}/{protocol}/{template}\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\nvlanid\n and \nprotocol\n is as above in \nAs JSON\n.\n\n\ntemplate\n is the name of a template file residing in the view path \napi/v4/dns/\n.\n\n\n\n\nRemember that the included ISC Bind templates can be \nskinned\n or you can add custom templates to your skin directory. More detail on this can be found in the dedicated section below.\n\n\nThe bundled ISC Bind templates can be used by setting \n{template}\n to \nbind\n or \nbind-full\n in the above URL. For the example interface in the JSON above, the ISC Bind \nbind\n template would yield:\n\n\n67.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.

These IP addresses can show up in traceroutes (for example) and both IXPs and customers like to have these resolve to a hostname.  When creating  VLAN Interfaces  in IXP Manager there is a field called  IPv[4/6] Hostname . This is intended for this DNS ARPA purpose. Some customers have specific requirements for these while other smaller customers may not fully understand the use cases.

You can find the DB ID in IXP Manager in the VLAN table (select  VLANs  from the left hand side menu).  protocol  is either  4  for IPv4 or 6 for  IPv6 .   If either of these are invalid, the API will return with a HTTP 404 response.

This is nearly always true. A situation where it may be false is if you enabled IPv6 for a user; then that user subsequently decided to not use IPv6; then you unchecked the  IPv6 Enabled  box in the VLAN Interface form without removing address / hostname entries.  address  - this IPv4/6 address of the VLAN interface as assigned by the IXP.  hostname  - the configured hostname for this address as entered into  IXP Manager .  arpa : the generated ARPA record name for the IP address assigned by the IXP.

Use cases for MRTG are L2 interface statistics for bits / packets / errors / discards / broadcasts per second. Aggregate graphs for customer LAGs, overall customer traffic, all traffic over a switch / infrastructure / the entire IXP are all supported.\n\n\nsflow\n - while the MRTG backend looks at layer 2 statistics, sflow is used to provide layer 3 statistics such as per protocol (IPv4/6) graphs and peer to peer graphs.\n\n\n\n\nIn a typical production environment, you'd implement both MRTG and sflow to provide the complete set of features.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere is only a handful of configuration options required and these can be seen with documentation in \nconfig/grapher.php\n (remember to put your own local changes in \n.env\n rather than editing this file directly).\n\n\nThe only global (non-backend specific) options are:\n\n\n\n\nbackend\n - in a typical production environment this would be \n\"mrtg|sflow\"\n which means try the MRTG backend first and then sflow. We ship with this set as \n\"dummy\"\n so you can see sample graphs working out of the box.\n\n\ncache\n - as the industry standard is to graph at 5min intervals, the cache settings do not regenerate / reload / reprocess log / rrd / image files if we have cached them and they are less than 5mins old. This is enabled by default which is the recommended setting.\n\n\n\n\nBackend specific configuration and set-up instructions can be found in their own sections.\n\n\nGrapher Backends\n\uf0c1\n\n\nBackend: MRTG\n\uf0c1\n\n\nMRTG is a particularly efficient SNMP poller as, irrespective of how many times an interface is referenced for different graphs, it is only polled once per run.\n\n\nPer-second graphs are generated for bits, packets, errors, discards and broadcasts at 5min intervals. IXP Manager's Grapher system can use MRTG to poll switches and create traffic graphs for:\n\n\n\n\nAggregate IXP and Infrastructure Graphs\n\n\n\n\nThe MRTG script creates aggregate graphs for the entire IXP as well as per-infrastructure graphs. These graphs are available from the \nStatistics\n menu under \nOverall Peering Graphs\n. Also, the graphs on the admin dashboard are the monthly versions of these and will appear on the dashboard when configured as above.\n\n\n\n\nSwitch Aggregate Graphs\n\n\n\n\nThese are defined and built automatically from the switches you have defined. These graphs are the aggregate of all peering ports. These graphs are available from the \nStatistics\n menu under \nSwitch Aggregate Graphs\n.\n\n\n\n\nInter-Switch / Trunk Graphs\n\n\n\n\nIXP Manager does not currently support a frontend means of creating these definitions (but, as of March 2017, it is being worked on). For now, we do it manually via the \nIXP Manager v3 way\n.\n\n\nThese graphs will be available in the \nStatistics\n menu under \nInter-Switch / PoP Graphs\n.\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Graphs\n\n\n\n\nMRTG creates per port, per LAG and aggregate graphs for each member / customer.\n\n\nMRTG Setup and Configuration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou need to install some basic packages for MRTG to work - on Ubuntu for example, install:\n\n\napt-get install libconfig-general-perl libnetaddr-ip-perl mrtg\n\n\n\n\n\nYou also need a folder to store all MRTG files. For example:\n\n\nmkdir -p /srv/mrtg\n\n\n\n\n\nIn your `.env, you need to set the following options:\n\n\n# the database type to use - either log or rrd\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_DBTYPE=\nlog\n\n# where to store log/rrd/png files as created above. This is from the perspective\n# of the mrtg daemon so should also be local\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_WORKDIR=\n/tmp\n\n# where to find the WORKDIR above from IXP Manager\ns perspective. This can be the\n# same local directory as the workdir for same server or a URL to remote web server.\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_LOGDIR=\nhttp://collector.example.com/mrtg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now generate a MRTG configuration by executing a command such as:\n\n\n# output to stdout:\n\n./artisan grapher:generate-configuration -B mrtg\n\n# output to a named file\n\n./artisan grapher:generate-configuration -B mrtg -O /tmp/mrtg.cfg.candidate\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could also combine a syntax check before putting the resultant file live.

On FreeBSD, MRTG comes with an initd script by default and you can kick it off on boot with something like the following in rc.conf:\n\n\nmrtg_daemon_enable=\nYES\n\nmrtg_daemon_config=\n/etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, on Ubuntu it does not but it comes with a /etc/cron.d/mrtg file which kicks it off every five minutes (it will daemonise the first time and further cron jobs will have no effect).

As \nIXP Manager\n does not support multiple IXPs, this defaults to \nid=1\n. [Currently only supported via MRTG for \nprotocol=all\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninfrastructure\n: aggregate graph for the overall traffic on a specific IXP infrastructure. For many IXPs, they'll just have a single infrastructure and this will go unused as it would be the equivalent of \nixp\n above. \nid\n, which is mandatory, is the primary key of the infrastructure from the \ninfrastructure\n database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for \nprotocol=all\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvlan\n: aggregate graph for a specific VLAN. \nid\n, which is mandatory, is the primary key of the VLAN from the \nvlan\n database table. [Currently only supported via sflow for \nprotocol=ipv4|ipv6\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nswitch\n: aggregate graph of all peering traffic being switched by a specific switch (sum of all customer ports plus core ports). \nid\n, which is mandatory, is the primary key of the switch from the \nswitch\n database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for \nprotocol=all\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrunk\n: a legacy hold over from \nInter-Switch / Trunk Graphs\n above to be replaced with core bundles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nphsyicalinterface\n: traffic for an individual member port - a single physical switch port. \nid\n, which is mandatory, is the primary key of the physical interface from the \nphysicalinterface\n database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for \nprotocol=all\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvirtualinterface\n: if a member has a single connection (one switch port) then this is the same as \nphsyicalinterface\n above. However, if they have a LAG port then it's the aggregate traffic for all physical ports in the LAG. \nid\n, which is mandatory, is the primary key of the virtual interface from the \nvirtualinterface\n database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for \nprotocol=all\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncustomer\n: the aggregate traffic for all ports belonging to a customer across all infrastructures. \nid\n, which is mandatory, is the primary key of the customer from the \ncust\n database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for \nprotocol=all\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvlaninterface\n: aggregate traffic flowing through a members VLAN interface for a specific protocol. \nid\n, which is mandatory, is the primary key of the VLAN interface from the \nvlaninterface\n database table. [Currently only supported via sflow for \nprotocol=ipv4|ipv6\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\np2p\n: peer to peer traffic between two member VLAN interfaces. The source (\nsvli\n) and destination (\ndvli\n) VLAN interface IDs are required. \nsvli\n and \ndvli\n, which are mandatory, are primary keys of the VLAN interfaces from the \nvlaninterface\n database table. [Currently only supported via sflow for \nprotocol=ipv4|ipv6\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor additional options, it's always best to manually or programmatically examine the output for \ntype=json\n to see what is supported. The following is a general list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\n: one of:\n\n\n\n\njson\n - as demonstrated and described above;\n\n\nlog\n - MRTG  log file type output formatted as a JSON array;\n\n\nrrd\n - the RRD file for the requested graph type;\n\n\npng\n - the graph image itself (default).\n\n\npotentially others as supported / implemented by newer backends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nperiod\n: one of \nday\n, \nweek\n, \nmonth\n, \nyear\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncategory\n: one of \nbits\n, \npkts\n (packets), \nerrs\n (errors), \ndiscs\n (discards), \nbcasts\n (broadcasts). Bits is measured in bits per second, the rest in packets per second.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprotocol\n: one of \nall\n, \nipv4\n or \nipv6\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbackend\n: default is to let IXP Manager decide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI Access Control\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe grapher API can be accessed using the \nstandard API access mechanisms\n.\n\n\nEach graph (ixp, infrastructure, etc.) has an \nauthorise()\n method which determines who is allowed view a graph.

Use cases for MRTG are L2 interface statistics for bits / packets / errors / discards / broadcasts per second. Aggregate graphs for customer LAGs, overall customer traffic, all traffic over a switch / infrastructure / the entire IXP are all supported.  sflow  - while the MRTG backend looks at layer 2 statistics, sflow is used to provide layer 3 statistics such as per protocol (IPv4/6) graphs and peer to peer graphs.

If you use this method, you will need to have your periodic update script restart / stop the daemon when the configuration changes (as demonstrated in the above script).

Let's first look at supported graphs:    ixp : aggregate graph for an IXP's overall traffic.  id , which defaults to  1 , is the primary key of the IXP from the  ixp  database table. As  IXP Manager  does not support multiple IXPs, this defaults to  id=1 . [Currently only supported via MRTG for  protocol=all ]    infrastructure : aggregate graph for the overall traffic on a specific IXP infrastructure. For many IXPs, they'll just have a single infrastructure and this will go unused as it would be the equivalent of  ixp  above.  id , which is mandatory, is the primary key of the infrastructure from the  infrastructure  database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for  protocol=all ]    vlan : aggregate graph for a specific VLAN.  id , which is mandatory, is the primary key of the VLAN from the  vlan  database table. [Currently only supported via sflow for  protocol=ipv4|ipv6 ]    switch : aggregate graph of all peering traffic being switched by a specific switch (sum of all customer ports plus core ports).  id , which is mandatory, is the primary key of the switch from the  switch  database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for  protocol=all ]    trunk : a legacy hold over from  Inter-Switch / Trunk Graphs  above to be replaced with core bundles.    phsyicalinterface : traffic for an individual member port - a single physical switch port.  id , which is mandatory, is the primary key of the physical interface from the  physicalinterface  database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for  protocol=all ]    virtualinterface : if a member has a single connection (one switch port) then this is the same as  phsyicalinterface  above. However, if they have a LAG port then it's the aggregate traffic for all physical ports in the LAG.  id , which is mandatory, is the primary key of the virtual interface from the  virtualinterface  database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for  protocol=all ]    customer : the aggregate traffic for all ports belonging to a customer across all infrastructures.  id , which is mandatory, is the primary key of the customer from the  cust  database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for  protocol=all ]    vlaninterface : aggregate traffic flowing through a members VLAN interface for a specific protocol.  id , which is mandatory, is the primary key of the VLAN interface from the  vlaninterface  database table. [Currently only supported via sflow for  protocol=ipv4|ipv6 ]    p2p : peer to peer traffic between two member VLAN interfaces. The source ( svli ) and destination ( dvli ) VLAN interface IDs are required.  svli  and  dvli , which are mandatory, are primary keys of the VLAN interfaces from the  vlaninterface  database table. [Currently only supported via sflow for  protocol=ipv4|ipv6 ]    For additional options, it's always best to manually or programmatically examine the output for  type=json  to see what is supported. The following is a general list.    type : one of:   json  - as demonstrated and described above;  log  - MRTG  log file type output formatted as a JSON array;  rrd  - the RRD file for the requested graph type;  png  - the graph image itself (default).  potentially others as supported / implemented by newer backends.     period : one of  day ,  week ,  month ,  year .    category : one of  bits ,  pkts  (packets),  errs  (errors),  discs  (discards),  bcasts  (broadcasts). Bits is measured in bits per second, the rest in packets per second.    protocol : one of  all ,  ipv4  or  ipv6 .    backend : default is to let IXP Manager decide.",

Any mailing list members that are added separately without a matching user in IXP Manager are not interfered with.\n\n\nConfiguring Available Mailing Lists\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere is a sample configuration file which you need to copy as follows:\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\ncp config/mailinglists.php.dist config/mailinglists.php\n\n\n\n\n\nYou then need to edit this file as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the mailing list functionality by setting this to true:\n\n\n// Set the following to \ntrue\n to enable mailing list functionality:\n\n\nenabled\n =\n true,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this is not set to true, the user will not be offered subscription options and the CLI commands will not execute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the available mailing list(s) in the \nlists\n array. Here is an example:\n\n\nlists\n =\n [\n\n\n    \nmembers\n =\n [\n\n\n        \nname\n    =\n \nMembers\n Mailing List\n,\n\n\n        \ndesc\n    =\n \nA longer description as presented in IXP Manager.\n,\n\n\n        \nemail\n   =\n \nmembers@example.com\n,\n\n\n        \narchive\n =\n \nhttps://www.example.com/mailman/private/members/\n,\n\n\n        \nsyncpws\n =\n false,\n\n\n    ],\n\n\n    \ntech\n =\n [\n\n\n        \nname\n    =\n \nTech/Operations Mailing List\n,\n\n\n        \ndesc\n    =\n \nA longer description as presented in IXP Manager.\n,\n\n\n        \nemail\n   =\n \ntech@example.com\n,\n\n\n        \narchive\n =\n \nhttps://www.example.com/mailman/private/tech/\n\n\n        \nsyncpws\n =\n false,\n\n\n    ],\n\n\n],\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the \nmembers\n and \ntech\n array keys above are the list handles that will be used by the API interfaces later. It is also important that they match the Mailman list key.\n\n\nHistorically, mailing list passwords were also sync'd from the IXP Manager user database \nunless\n \nsyncpws\n is both defined and false for the given list. As we are now recommending \nbcrypt\n as the standard password hashing mechanism, we no longer recommend this and suggest allowing Mailman to manage its own passwords.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaths to Mailman commands. These will be used in the API/CLI elements later:\n\n\nmailman\n =\n [\n\n\n    \ncmds\n =\n [\n\n\n        \nlist_members\n   =\n \n/usr/local/mailman/bin/list_members\n,\n\n\n        \nadd_members\n    =\n \n/usr/local/mailman/bin/add_members -r - -w n -a n\n,\n\n\n        \nremove_members\n =\n \n/usr/local/mailman/bin/remove_members -f - -n -N\n,\n\n\n        \nchangepw\n       =\n \n/usr/local/mailman/bin/withlist -q -l -r changepw\n\n\n    ]\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of Usage\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis mailing list synchronisation / integration code was written for existing Mailman lists we have at INEX where some lists are public with subscribers that will never have an account on INEX's IXP Manager. As such, these scripts are written so that email addresses in common between IXP Manager and Mailman can manage their subscriptions in IXP Manager but those other subscribers will be unaffected.\n\n\nUsers in IXP Manager will either be marked as being subscribed to a list, not subscribed to a list or neither (i.e. a new user). Subscriptions are managed by user preferences (in the database) of the format:\n\n\nmailinglist.listname1.subscribed = 0/1\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are four steps to performing the synchronisation \nfor each list\n which are done by either using the IXP Manager CLI script \n$IXPROOT/bin/ixptool.php\n or the older \nAPI V1\n interface.\n\n\nCLI Interface Overview\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe execution of the \nmailing-list-cli.list-init\n script which is really for new IXP Manager users (or initial set up of the mailing list feature). This script is piped the full subscribers list from Mailman (via \nlist_members\n). This function will iterate through all users and, if they have no preference set for subscription to this list, will either add a \"not subscribed\" preference if their email address is not in the provided list of subscribers or a \"subscribed\" preference if it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe execution of the \nmailing-list-cli.get-subscribed\n action which lists all users who are subscribed to the given mailing list based on their user preferences. This is piped to the \nadd_members\n Mailman script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe execution of the \nmailing-list-cli.get-unsubscribed\n action which lists all users who are unsubscribed to the given mailing list based on their user preferences. This is piped to the \nremove_members\n Mailman script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe execution of the \nmailing-list-cli.password-sync\n action which sets the mailing list password for  all users who are unsubscribed to the given mailing list based on their IXP Manager user password. This action \nexec()\n's' the change password command directly. \nSee Password Synchronisation below.\n Unlike the above three operations, the password sync executes a command directly (via PHP \nexec()\n). If you just want to print the commands to stdout, add the parameters \n-v -p noexec=1\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI V1 Interface Overview\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe CLI version of mailing list management was presented above. If you wish to use the API version, proceed as follows where:\n\n\n\n\n$MyKey\n is one of your SUPERUSER API keys;\n\n\nhttps://www.example.com/ixp/\n is your IXP Manager web interface;\n\n\nmembers\n is an example mailing list handle as defined above in \n$IXPROOT/config/mailinglists.php\n.\n\n\n\n\nUse the initialisation function for new IXP Manager users (or initial set up of the mailing list feature) which updates IXP Manager with all currently subscribed mailing list members:\n\n\n/path/to/mailman/bin/list_members members \n/tmp/ml-listname1.txt\ncurl -f --data-urlencode addresses@/tmp/ml-listname1.txt \n\\\n\n    \nhttps://www.example.com/ixp/apiv1/mailing-list/init/key/\n$MyKey\n/list/members\n\nrm /tmp/ml-listname1.txt\n\n\n\n\n\nPipe all subscribed users to the \nadd_members\n Mailman script:\n\n\ncurl -f \nhttps://www.example.com/ixp/apiv1/mailing-list/get-subscribed/key/\n$MyKey\n/list/members\n \n|\n \n\\\n\n    /path/to/mailman/bin/add_members -r - -w n -a n members \n/dev/null\n\n\n\n\n\nPipe all users who are unsubscribed to the \nremove_members\n Mailman script:\n\n\ncurl -f \nhttps://www.example.com/ixp/apiv1/mailing-list/get-unsubscribed/key/\n$MyKey\n/list/members\n \n|\n \n\\\n\n    /path/to/mailman/bin/remove_members -f - -n -N members \n/dev/null\n\n\n\n\n\nSync the passwords from IXP Manager to Mailman with something like:\n\n\ncurl -f \nhttps://www.example.com/ixp/apiv1/mailing-list/password-sync/key/MyKey/list/listname1\n \n|\n \n\\\n\n    egrep \n^/path/to/mailman/bin/withlist -q -l -r changepw \n.+\n \n.+\n \n.+\n$\n \n|\n /bin/sh \n/dev/null\n\n\n\n\n\n(Feel free to make the above regexp more secure and update this document).\n        \n\n\nHow to Implement\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou can implement mailing list management by configuring IXP Manager as above.\n\n\nIXP Manager will then generate shell scripts to manage all of the above.\n\n\nExecute the following command for the CLI version:\n\n\nbin/ixptool.php -a mailing-list-cli.sync-script \nbin/mailing-list-sync.sh\n\n\n\n\n\nOr the following for the API V1 version \n(and make sure to update the assignments at the top of the script)\n:\n\n\nbin/ixptool.php -a mailing-list-cli.sync-script --p1\n=\napiv1 \nbin/mailing-list-sync-apiv1.sh\n\n\n\n\n\nThis generates a script called \nmailing-list-sync[-apiv1].sh\n which performs each of the above four steps for each configured mailing list.

You need a working Nagios installation first and then IXP Manager will automate the above areas of the configuration.\n\n\nHistorical Notes\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIf you have used Nagios on IXP Manager \n4.5, then how the configuration is generated has changed. The \nolder documentation may be available here\n. In previous versions of IXP Manager, we generated entire / monolithic Nagios configuration files. We have found in practice that this does not scale well and creates a number of limitations.\n\n\nIXP Manager \n= v4.5 now simply creates the targets on a per VLAN and protocol basis.\n\n\nSample Scripts\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou will find sample scripts for pulling Nagios configuration from IXP Manager and reloading Nagios at:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/tree/master/tools/runtime/nagios\n\n\nMonitoring Member Reachability\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWe monitor all member router interfaces (unless asked not to) via ICMP[v6] pings with Nagios. This is all controlled by the Nagios configuration created with this feature.\n\n\nTo enable / disable these checks, edit the VLAN interface configuration and set IPvX Can Ping appropriately. \nNote that when IPvX Can Ping is disabled, the host definition is created anyway as this would be used for other Nagios checks such as route collector sessions.\n\n\nThere is an additional option when editing a member's VLAN interface called \nBusy Host\n. This changes the Nagios ping fidelity from \n250.0,20%!500.0,60%\n to \n1000.0,80%!2000.0,90%\n (using the default object definitions which are configurable). This is useful for routers with slow / rate limited control planes.\n\n\nMembers are added to a number of hostgroups also:\n\n\n\n\na per-switch hostgroup;\n\n\na per cabinet hostgroup;\n\n\na per location / data centre hostgroup;\n\n\nan all members hostgroup.\n\n\n\n\nThese hostgroups are very useful to single out issues and for post-maintenance checks.\n\n\nYou can use the \nIXP Manager\n API to get the Nagios configuration for a given VLAN and protocol using the following endpoint format (both GET and POST requests work):\n\n\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/nagios/customers/{vlanid}/{protocol}\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\nvlanid\n is the database ID (\nDB ID\n) of the VLAN. You can find the DB ID in IXP Manager in the VLAN table (select \nVLANs\n from the left hand side menu).\n\n\nprotocol\n is either \n4\n for \nIPv4\n or 6 for \nIPv6\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf either of these are invalid, the API will return with a HTTP 404 response.\n\n\nAnd example of a target in the reponse is:\n\n\n###############################################################################################\n###\n### Packet Clearing House DNS\n###\n### Equinix DB2 (Kilcarbery) / Packet Clearing House DNS / swi1-kcp1-1.\n###\n\n### Host: 185.6.36.60 / inex.woodynet.net / Peering VLAN #1.\n\ndefine host {\n    use                     ixp-manager-member-host\n    host_name               packet-clearing-house-dns-as42-ipv4-vlanid2-vliid109\n    alias                   Packet Clearing House DNS / swi1-kcp1-1 / Peering VLAN #1.\n    address                 185.6.36.60\n}\n\n### Service: 185.6.36.60 / inex.woodynet.net / Peering VLAN #1.\n\ndefine service {\n    use                     ixp-manager-member-ping-service\n    host_name               packet-clearing-house-dns-as42-ipv4-vlanid2-vliid109\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Nagios for Member Reachability\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou will notice that the above configuration example is very light and is missing an awful lot of Nagios required configuration directives. This is intentional so that IXP Manager is not too prescriptive and allows you to define your own Nagios objects without having to resort to skinning IXP Manager.\n\n\nTwo of the most important elements of Nagios configuration which you need to understand are \nobject definitions\n and \nobject inheritance\n.\n\n\nYou can pass three optional parameters to Nagios via GET/POST and these are:\n\n\n\n\nhost_definition\n; defaults to: \nixp-manager-member-host\n.\n\n\nservice_definition\n; defaults to \nixp-manager-member-service\n.\n\n\nping_service_definition\n; defaults to: \nixp-manager-member-ping-service\n.\n\n\nping_busy_service_definition\n; defaults to: \nixp-manager-member-ping-busy-service\n.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of changing two of these parameters is:\n\n\ncurl --data \nhost_definition=my-host-def\nservice_definition=my-service-def\n -X POST \n\\\n\n    -H \nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n \n\\\n\n    -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\n \n\\\n\n    https://ixpexample.com/api/v4/nagios/customers/2/4\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of the three objects that INEX use for this are:\n\n\ndefine host {\n    name                    ixp-manager-member-host\n    check_command           check-host-alive\n    check_period            24x7\n    max_check_attempts      10\n    notification_interval   120\n    notification_period     24x7\n    notification_options    d,u,r\n    contact_groups          admins\n    register                0\n}\n\ndefine service {\n    name                    ixp-manager-member-service\n    check_period            24x7\n    max_check_attempts      10\n    check_interval          5\n    retry_check_interval    1\n    contact_groups          admins\n    notification_interval   120\n    notification_period     24x7\n    notification_options    w,u,c,r\n    register                0\n}\n\ndefine service {\n    name                    ixp-manager-member-ping-service\n    use                     ixp-manager-member-service\n    service_description     PING\n    check_command           check_ping!250.0,20%!500.0,60%\n    register                0\n}\n\ndefine service {\n    name                    ixp-manager-member-ping-busy-service\n    use                     ixp-manager-member-service\n    service_description     PING-Busy\n    check_command           check_ping!1000.0,80%!2000.0,90%\n    register                0\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nTemplates / Skinning\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou can use \nskinning\n to make changes to the bundled \ndefault\n template or, \npreferably\n, add your own.\n\n\nLet's say you wanted to add your own template called \nmytemplate1\n and your skin is named \nmyskin\n.

An example of the hostgroups produced include:\n\n\n\n\nixp-production-switches-infraid-2\n: all switches on an infrastructure with DB ID 2;\n\n\nixp-switches-infraid-2-dc-dub1\n: all switches in location dc-dub1;\n\n\nixp-switches-infraid-2-extreme\n: all Extreme switches on an infrastructure with DB ID 2; and\n\n\nixp-switches-infraid-2-extreme-x670g2-48x-4q\n: all Extreme switches of model X670G2-48x-4q on an infrastructure with DB ID 2.\n\n\n\n\nUsing these, you can create generic service definitions to apply to all hosts such as:\n\n\ndefine service{\n    use                             my-ixp-production-switch-service\n    hostgroup_name                  ixp-production-switches-infraid-1, ixp-production-switches-infraid-2\n    service_description             ping - IPv4\n    check_command                   check_ping_ipv4!10!100.0,10%!200.0,20%\n}\n\ndefine service  {\n    use                             my-ixp-production-switch-service\n    hostgroup_name                  ixp-production-switches-infraid-1, ixp-production-switches-infraid-2\n    service_description             SSH\n    check_command                   check_ssh\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can target vendor / model specific checks as appropriate:\n\n\ndefine service{\n    use                             my-ixp-production-switch-service\n    hostgroup_name                  ixp-switches-infraid-1-extreme, ixp-switches-infraid-2-extreme\n    service_description             Chassis\n    check_command                   check_extreme_chassis\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one thing you'll need to keep an eye on is adding hostgroups to service checks as you create new infrastructures / add new switch vendors / models.\n\n\nHint:\n over the years, we at \nINEX\n have written a number of switch chassis check scripts and these can be found on Github at \nbarryo/nagios-plugins\n.\n\n\nFor example the Extreme version checks and returns something like:\n\n\n\n\nOK - CPU: 5sec - 10%.

To enable / disable these checks, edit the VLAN interface configuration and set IPvX Can Ping appropriately.  Note that when IPvX Can Ping is disabled, the host definition is created anyway as this would be used for other Nagios checks such as route collector sessions.  There is an additional option when editing a member's VLAN interface called  Busy Host . This changes the Nagios ping fidelity from  250.0,20%!500.0,60%  to  1000.0,80%!2000.0,90%  (using the default object definitions which are configurable). This is useful for routers with slow / rate limited control planes.  Members are added to a number of hostgroups also:   a per-switch hostgroup;  a per cabinet hostgroup;  a per location / data centre hostgroup;  an all members hostgroup.   These hostgroups are very useful to single out issues and for post-maintenance checks.

You can use the  IXP Manager  API to get the Nagios configuration for a given infrastructure using the following endpoint format (both GET and POST requests work):  https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/nagios/switches/{infraid}  where:   infraid  is the database ID ( DB ID ) of the infrastructure. You can find the DB ID in IXP Manager in the infrastructures table (select  Infrastructures  from the left hand side menu).   You can use  skinning  to make changes to the bundled  default  template or,  preferably , add your own.  Let's say you wanted to add your own template called  myswtemplate1  and your skin is named  myskin .

An example of the hostgroups produced include:   ixp-production-switches-infraid-2 : all switches on an infrastructure with DB ID 2;  ixp-switches-infraid-2-dc-dub1 : all switches in location dc-dub1;  ixp-switches-infraid-2-extreme : all Extreme switches on an infrastructure with DB ID 2; and  ixp-switches-infraid-2-extreme-x670g2-48x-4q : all Extreme switches of model X670G2-48x-4q on an infrastructure with DB ID 2.   Using these, you can create generic service definitions to apply to all hosts such as:  define service{\n    use                             my-ixp-production-switch-service\n    hostgroup_name                  ixp-production-switches-infraid-1, ixp-production-switches-infraid-2\n    service_description             ping - IPv4\n    check_command                   check_ping_ipv4!10!100.0,10%!200.0,20%\n}\n\ndefine service  {\n    use                             my-ixp-production-switch-service\n    hostgroup_name                  ixp-production-switches-infraid-1, ixp-production-switches-infraid-2\n    service_description             SSH\n    check_command                   check_ssh\n}  You can target vendor / model specific checks as appropriate:  define service{\n    use                             my-ixp-production-switch-service\n    hostgroup_name                  ixp-switches-infraid-1-extreme, ixp-switches-infraid-2-extreme\n    service_description             Chassis\n    check_command                   check_extreme_chassis\n}  The one thing you'll need to keep an eye on is adding hostgroups to service checks as you create new infrastructures / add new switch vendors / models.  Hint:  over the years, we at  INEX  have written a number of switch chassis check scripts and these can be found on Github at  barryo/nagios-plugins .

            "text": "Patch Panels / Cross Connects\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOne of the more difficult things for an IXP to manage is the sheer volume of patch panels / cross connects they need to manage. We have approached the issue a number of times in IXP Manger but abandoned the attempt every time. Typically our original solutions were over-engineered where all we really needed was something which could replace a spreadsheet per panel.\n\n\nWe believe we have now developed a feature complete and useful means of managing patch panels and associated cross connects.\n\n\nFeatures\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nAdd / edit patch panels  (which includes cable and connector types).\n\n\nList associated patch panel ports which includes:\n\n\ntheir state (such as available / prewired, awaiting cross connect, connected, awaiting cease, reserved, broken).\n\n\nassociated customer and/or switchport.\n\n\nco-location provider's circuit reference.\n\n\ninternal ticket references.\n\n\nTransition ports from available / prewired to awaiting x-connect to connected to awaiting cease to ceased and then available again.\n\n\nCustomer view of their cross connects.\n\n\nPublic (visible to customers) and private notes per cross connect.\n\n\nAttach public and private files to cross connects (such as test results, completion documents, order forms, etc).\n\n\nMaintain complete history of a patch panel port.\n\n\nGenerate and email LoAs (as PDF) with a URL verification function for co-location providers.\n\n\nGenerate emails for connection and cease requests as well as an email providing full customer view of a cross connect.\n\n\nTypically fibre ports are \nduplex\n ports but there is a growing use of BiDi optics meaning simplex ports. Our implementation treats all ports as simplex but you can mark it as duplex and set its partner port.\n\n\n\n\nDuplex Fibre Ports\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWe suggest adding fibre ports as two ports per duplex port. I.e. if your patch panel has 12 duplex ports, enter this as 24 ports. When allocating ports later, you can set it as a duplex port and select its \npartner / slave port\n. This will future proof your patch panels for the growing use of bidi optics and other simplex based xWDM fibre solutions.\n\n\nFrom our experience, duplex fibre ports are often identified as their individual strands. For example, \nduplex port 5\n would be referenced as \nF9/F10\n.\n\n\nYour mileage may vary on this but we need to allow this flexibility to cover both use-cases. You always have options however:\n\n\n\n\nyou can change the presentation of how these ports are referenced externally by \nskinning\n the templates.\n\n\nyou have the option to edit emails before they are sent to also present this as you wish.\n\n\nyou can chose to treat duplex ports as single ports rather than doubling them up.\n\n\nwhen you have duplex ports on a patch panel, IXP Manager will provide a duplex view by default with a CSS-based toggle to reveal the typical partner ports.\n\n\nif you think IXP Manager can make this easier, please talk to us. \nBut we cannot cover every use case programatically. We've opted to allow flexibility rather than dictate a particular format.\n\n\n\n\nAdding a Patch Panel\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe following image shows a typical \nadd a new patch panel\n form (as of v4.3). You'll note that clicking \nHelp\n provides detailed context aware help messages.\n\n\n\n\nMost of this is self-explanatory but:\n\n\n\n\nBy default, we set the \nColocation Reference\n to the \nPatch Panel Name\n. We are not sure it's a good idea for IXPs to create a second name different to the co-location provider's but this option is available to you. \nSeriously, think about what you are doing here - more references means more confusion!\n The cabinet and cable type is displayed in the list of patch panels so even with obscure data centre references, it should be easy to find what you need.\n\n\nLocation Notes\n: Data centre / co-location providers do a lot of weird, wonderful and strange things! They provide multiple references for a single patch panel (IXP cabinet, MMR, etc.), they get taken over and re-reference everything or even provide no discernable reference. The field is a freetext field that will be included (and parsed as Markdown) in all emails generated by IXP Manager to help you help them identify a patch panel!\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to that, we will also use a cabinets \nU's are counted from top/bottom\n, and a patch panel's \nU position\n and \nmounted at front/rear\n to also create a location description.\n\n When setting the \nNumber of Ports\n, ensure you count duplex fibre ports as \ntwo ports\n. So 12 duplex fibre ports would be entered as 24. When editing a patch panel, this input field represents the number of additional ports you want to add to a patch panel and thus defaults to 0 in that situation.\n\n \nPort Name Prefix\n: This is an optional field intended for use on fibre patch panels. As an example, you may wish to prefix individual fibre strands in a duplex port with F which would mean the name of a duplex port would be displayed as F1/F2.\n* \nChargeable\n: Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. Setting this only sets the default option when allocating ports to members later. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other.\n\n\nFiltering Patch Panel Ports\n\uf0c1\n\n\nQuite often, all you are looking for is a free in a particular location (data centre) or cabinet of a particular cable type (UTP / SMF / etc.).\n\n\nIXP Manager makes this easy from the \nPatch Panels\n page via the top right button labeled \nFilter Options\n. When clicked, this yields an advanced search as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCabinets auto-fills when you chose (or change) a location.\n\n\nPatch Panel Port States\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA patch panel port can have the following states:\n\n\n\n\nAvailable\n: The port is free and available for use.\n\n\nPrewired\n: This is equivalent to available but it means the port is prewired to a given switchport (you set the port when setting the prewired status). This is useful for IXPs that prewire a bunch of ports to avoid remote hands costs / data centre visits.\n\n\nAwaiting Xconnect\n: Port has been assigned to a member and we are awaiting the co-location provider to install the cross connect. In this state, context aware actions such as emailing connection requests, LoA generation and \nSet Connected\n are all available.\n\n\nConnected\n: Connected and in use.\n\n\nAwaiting Cease\n: This connection is no longer required and we are awaiting the end user / co-location provider to cease the connection.\n\n\nCeased\n: You will never see a ceased state. When a cross connect is marked as ceased, it's current state is archived (for history, include files) and the port is reset to \nAvailable\n. We do not revert to \nPrewired\n but an information message is shown to the user to hint this.\n\n\nReserved\n: Useful to mark particular ports as \noff limits\n for whatever reason.\n\n\nBroken\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\nFree / Available Ports\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIXP Manager will colour ports in the \nAvailable\n, \nPrewired\n and \nAwaiting Cease\n states are green allowing an easy visual indication of available ports.\n\n\nPatch Panel Port Lifecycle\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPatch panel ports start as either \navailable\n or \nprewired\n. The context menu in these states is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnset Prewired\n is available as this port has a \nPrewired\n status. Clicking this reverts it to plain \nAvailable\n and disassociates it from the prewired port.\n\n\nEdit Note...\n is always available and provides a pop up to edit public and private notes associated with the port (current lifecycle - ceased ports have their notes at that time archived and cleared).\n\n\n\n\nThe main lifecycle option here is \nAllocate\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n: A one line short description to be shown in the list of patch panel ports. Just enough to help explain the ports purpose. Detailed information should be placed in the notes section. Can also be used to explain a reserved / broken / other port. Note that this is parsed as Markdown. \nNB:\n A description is discouraged for customer ports connected to a switch. The customer name and switch port are the description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColocation Circuit Reference\n: this is the reference provided by the colocation provider to uniquely reference this cross connect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTicket Reference(s)\n: This is a free text field to be used by IXPs as they wish. The intended use is to enter helpdesk ticket references that relate to this cross connect order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuplex connection?\n: Clicking this allows you to select the slave port for duplex connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch / Switch Port\n / \nCustomer\n: You have a number of options when allocating a port:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the port is pre-wired then the switch / switch port will be set here.\n\n\n\n\nIf you chose a switch port which has been allocated to a customer, then this patch panel port will also be allocated to that customer. The backend logic will detect if this is the case and update the customer field.\n\n\nConversely, if you chose a customer first, the switch / switch port dropdowns will be populated with only that customer's assigned ports.\n\n\nSometimes you will get cross connects that are not intended to be connected to peering switches (e.g. connections to co-located customer equipment, IXP metro connections, etc.). In these cases, just select the customer (and if it's the IXP itself, select the IXP customer) and leave switch / switch port unselected.\n\n\n\n\nIf you need to reset these fields, just click either of the Reset button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatch Panel Port Status\n: when allocating a port, this will allow you to set the state to \nAwaiting Xconnect\n or \nConnected\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Interface Status\n: this is not depicted above. If the selected switch port has already been assigned to a customer by way of a physical interface, you will have the option to update this here also.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic\n and \nPrivate Notes\n: Public notes are available to the customer. Both fields are interpreted as Markdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChargeable\n: Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other. How individual IXPs use this is up to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Use\n: Marks the port as used by the IXP itself.

This will future proof your patch panels for the growing use of bidi optics and other simplex based xWDM fibre solutions.  From our experience, duplex fibre ports are often identified as their individual strands. For example,  duplex port 5  would be referenced as  F9/F10 .  Your mileage may vary on this but we need to allow this flexibility to cover both use-cases. You always have options however:   you can change the presentation of how these ports are referenced externally by  skinning  the templates.  you have the option to edit emails before they are sent to also present this as you wish.  you can chose to treat duplex ports as single ports rather than doubling them up.  when you have duplex ports on a patch panel, IXP Manager will provide a duplex view by default with a CSS-based toggle to reveal the typical partner ports.  if you think IXP Manager can make this easier, please talk to us.

Most of this is self-explanatory but:   By default, we set the  Colocation Reference  to the  Patch Panel Name . We are not sure it's a good idea for IXPs to create a second name different to the co-location provider's but this option is available to you.  Seriously, think about what you are doing here - more references means more confusion!  The cabinet and cable type is displayed in the list of patch panels so even with obscure data centre references, it should be easy to find what you need.  Location Notes : Data centre / co-location providers do a lot of weird, wonderful and strange things! They provide multiple references for a single patch panel (IXP cabinet, MMR, etc.), they get taken over and re-reference everything or even provide no discernable reference. The field is a freetext field that will be included (and parsed as Markdown) in all emails generated by IXP Manager to help you help them identify a patch panel!   In addition to that, we will also use a cabinets  U's are counted from top/bottom , and a patch panel's  U position  and  mounted at front/rear  to also create a location description.  When setting the  Number of Ports , ensure you count duplex fibre ports as  two ports . So 12 duplex fibre ports would be entered as 24. When editing a patch panel, this input field represents the number of additional ports you want to add to a patch panel and thus defaults to 0 in that situation.   Port Name Prefix : This is an optional field intended for use on fibre patch panels. As an example, you may wish to prefix individual fibre strands in a duplex port with F which would mean the name of a duplex port would be displayed as F1/F2.\n*  Chargeable : Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that.

Edit Note...  is always available and provides a pop up to edit public and private notes associated with the port (current lifecycle - ceased ports have their notes at that time archived and cleared).   The main lifecycle option here is  Allocate :     Description : A one line short description to be shown in the list of patch panel ports. Just enough to help explain the ports purpose. Detailed information should be placed in the notes section. Can also be used to explain a reserved / broken / other port. Note that this is parsed as Markdown.  NB:  A description is discouraged for customer ports connected to a switch. The customer name and switch port are the description.    Colocation Circuit Reference : this is the reference provided by the colocation provider to uniquely reference this cross connect.    Ticket Reference(s) : This is a free text field to be used by IXPs as they wish. The intended use is to enter helpdesk ticket references that relate to this cross connect order.    Duplex connection? : Clicking this allows you to select the slave port for duplex connections.    Switch / Switch Port  /  Customer : You have a number of options when allocating a port:    If the port is pre-wired then the switch / switch port will be set here.   If you chose a switch port which has been allocated to a customer, then this patch panel port will also be allocated to that customer. The backend logic will detect if this is the case and update the customer field.  Conversely, if you chose a customer first, the switch / switch port dropdowns will be populated with only that customer's assigned ports.  Sometimes you will get cross connects that are not intended to be connected to peering switches (e.g. connections to co-located customer equipment, IXP metro connections, etc.). In these cases, just select the customer (and if it's the IXP itself, select the IXP customer) and leave switch / switch port unselected.   If you need to reset these fields, just click either of the Reset button.    Patch Panel Port Status : when allocating a port, this will allow you to set the state to  Awaiting Xconnect  or  Connected .    Physical Interface Status : this is not depicted above.

A route collector is an IXP router which serves only to \naccept all routes and export no routes\n. It is used for problem diagnosis, to aid customer monitoring and for looking glasses (see \nINEX's here\n).\n\n\nThe \nstandard configuration\n simply pulls in a fairly standard header (sets up router ID, listening address and - for the collector at least - some unused filters) and creates a session for all customer routers on the given VLAN.\n\n\nWhen adding a router, you give it a \nhandle\n. For example: \nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n which, for INEX, would mean a route collector on peering LAN1 using IPv4. Then - for the given router handle - the configuration can be generated and pulled using the API as follows:\n\n\n#! /bin/sh\n\n\n\n# The API Key.\n\n\n# This is generated in IXP Manager via the top right menu: *My Account -\n API Keys*\n\n\nKEY\n=\nyour-admin-ixp-manager-api-key\n\n\n\n# The base URL of your IXP Manager install plus: \napi/v4/router/gen-config\n\n\nURL\n=\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/gen-config\n\n\n\n# The handle is as described above:\n\n\nHANDLE\n=\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n\n\n\n# Then the configuration can be pulled as follows:\n\ncurl --fail -s -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: \n${\nKEY\n}\n \n${\nURL\n}\n/\n${\nHANDLE\n}\n \n${\nHANDLE\n}\n.conf\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigurations for the route server and AS112 templates can be configured just as easily.\n\n\nThe stock templates for both are secure and well tested and can be used by setting the \ntemplate\n element of the router to one of the following:\n\n\n\n\nAS112: \n'api/v4/router/as112/bird/standard'\n\n\nRoute Collector: \n'api/v4/router/collector/bird/standard'\n\n\nRoute Server: \n'api/v4/router/server/bird/standard'\n\n\n\n\nWe also provide sample scripts for automating the re-configuration of these services by cron:\n\n\n\n\nAS112 scripts \ncan be found here\n.\n\n\nRoute collector scripts \ncan be found here\n.\n\n\nRoute server scripts \ncan be found here\n\n See the \n-v4\n scripts \nin this directory\n. These are quite robust and have been in production for ~3 years at INEX (as of Jan 2017).\n\n\n\n\nAll of these scripts have been written defensivily such that if there is any issue getting the configuring or validating the configuration then the running router instance should be unaffected. This has worked in practice at INEX when IXP Manager was under maintenance, when there were management connectivity issues and when there were database issues. They also use the \nupdated API\n (see below) to mark when the router configuration update script ran successfully.\n\n\nUpdated API\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIt can be useful to know that the scripts for updating the router configuration for AS112, route collector and route server BGP daemons run successfully. At INEX for example, we have three LANs and so 10 individual servers running a total of 30 Bird instances which is unwieldy to check and monitor manually.\n\n\nWhen viewing routers in IXP Manager, you may have noticed the \nLast Updated\n column which will initially show \n(unknown)\n. All our update scripts (see above) trigger the updated API call when a route configuration run has completed successfully. Note that this does not mean that a configuration has necessarily changed but rather that the update script ran and executed correctly. In other words: \nthe configuration was successfully pulled from IXP Manager, compared to the running configuration and, if changed, successfully applied\n.\n\n\nThe API call to update the \nlast updated\n field to \nnow\n is a POST as follows:\n\n\ncurl -s -X POST -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\n \\\n    https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/updated/{handle}\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n{handle}\n should be replaced with the route handle as described above.\n\n\nThe result is a JSON object with the datetime as set and is equivalent to the result of the following API call which fetchs the \nlast updated\n field without setting it:\n\n\ncurl -s -X GET -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\n \\\n    https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/updated/{handle}\n\n{\nlast_updated\n:\n2017-05-21T19:14:43+00:00\n,\nlast_updated_unix\n:1495394083}\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two useful additional API endpoints. To get the last updated time of \nall\n routers, use:\n\n\ncurl -s -X GET -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\n \\\n    https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/updated\n\n{\nhandle1\n:{\nlast_updated\n:\n2017-05-21T19:14:43+00:00\n,\nlast_updated_unix\n:1495394083},\n \nhandle2\n:{\nlast_updated\n:null,\nlast_updated_unix\n:null},\n ...}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above output shows the format of the reply as well as the fact that routers without a last updated value set will be included as null values.\n\n\nLastly, you can request the last updated time of routers where that time exceeds a given number of seconds. \nIn this call, routers without a last updated time will not be returned.\n This is useful for monitoring applications such as Nagios where you would want a warning / alert on any routers that have not updated in the last day for example:\n\n\ncurl -s -X GET -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\n \\\n    https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/updated-before/86400\n\n[]\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example also shows that an empty JSON object is returned for an empty result. Otherwise the format of the reply is the same as for the call above for all routers:\n\n\n{\nhandle1\n:{\nlast_updated\n:\n2017-05-21T19:14:43+00:00\n,\nlast_updated_unix\n:1495394083},...}\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWe use \nTravis CI\n to test IXP Manager before pushing new releases. The primary purpose of this is to ensure that the configuration for routers generated matches known good configurations from the same sample database.\n\n\nThese known good configurations also serve as useful examples of what the standard IXP Manager configuration generates.\n\n\nSee \nthese known good configurations here\n with the prefix \nci-apiv4-\n and:\n\n\n\n\nas112\n: AS112 router configurations conforming to \nrfc7534\n (AS112 Nameserver Operations) and implementing \nrfc7535\n (AS112 Redirection Using DNAME). There are configs to serve queries over both IPv4 and IPv6. See \nthe AS112 documentation for more details\n.\n\n\nrc1\n: route collector configurations. Peering with the route collector is mandatory at many IXPs including INEX. These are incredably useful for monitoring, diagnosing issues and providing looking glasses. We also use the quarantine version of these for turning up new member connections.\n\n\nrs1\n: route collector configurations. See below for full details of what these implement. Note also that the \nci-apiv4-rs1-lan2-ipv4.conf\n file includes BGP large communities (\nrfc8092\n). See \nthe route servers documentation for more details\n.\n\n\n\n\nLive Status\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe live status of any configured routers that have API access can be seen in \nIXP Manager\n via the \nLive Status\n sub-menu option of \nRouters\n on the left hand side menu.\n\n\nEach router is queried twice via AJAX requests to provide:\n\n\n\n\nBGP daemon version\n\n\nAPI version\n\n\nconfigured BGP sessions\n\n\nestablished BGP sessions\n\n\nlast updated time\n\n\nlast reboot time",

The result is a JSON object with the datetime as set and is equivalent to the result of the following API call which fetchs the  last updated  field without setting it:  curl -s -X GET -H  X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key  \\\n    https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/updated/{handle}\n\n{ last_updated : 2017-05-21T19:14:43+00:00 , last_updated_unix :1495394083}  There are two useful additional API endpoints. To get the last updated time of  all  routers, use:  curl -s -X GET -H  X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key  \\\n    https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/updated\n\n{ handle1 :{ last_updated : 2017-05-21T19:14:43+00:00 , last_updated_unix :1495394083},\n  handle2 :{ last_updated :null, last_updated_unix :null},\n ...}  The above output shows the format of the reply as well as the fact that routers without a last updated value set will be included as null values.  Lastly, you can request the last updated time of routers where that time exceeds a given number of seconds.  In this call, routers without a last updated time will not be returned.  This is useful for monitoring applications such as Nagios where you would want a warning / alert on any routers that have not updated in the last day for example:  curl -s -X GET -H  X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key  \\\n    https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/updated-before/86400\n\n[]  This example also shows that an empty JSON object is returned for an empty result. Otherwise the format of the reply is the same as for the call above for all routers:  { handle1 :{ last_updated : 2017-05-21T19:14:43+00:00 , last_updated_unix :1495394083},...}",

Presuming it is installed.\n\n\nHistorical Notes\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIf you have used Smokeping on IXP Manager \n4.5, then how the configuration is generated has changed. The \nolder documentation may be available here\n. In previous versions of IXP Manager, we generated entire / monolithic Smokeping configuration files. We have found in practice that this does not scale well and creates a number of limitations.\n\n\nIXP Manager \n= v4.5 now simply creates the targets on a per VLAN and protocol basis.\n\n\nTarget Selection\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis section explains the rules on how a member router (target) is selected to be included in the generated Smokeping configuration.\n\n\nWhen generating a list of targets per VLAN and protocol, the API call to IXP Manager will select all VLAN interfaces (member routers) where:\n\n\n\n\nthat protocol (IPv4/6) is enabled for the member;\n\n\nCan Ping\n has been checked for that protocol; and\n\n\nthe virtual interface pertaining to the VLAN interface has at least on physical interface in the connected state.\n\n\n\n\nGenerating Smokeping Targets\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou can use the \nIXP Manager\n API to get the Smokeping target configurations for a given VLAN and protocol using the following endpoint format (both GET and POST requests work):\n\n\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/vlan/smokeping/{vlanid}/{protocol}\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\nvlanid\n is the database ID (\nDB ID\n) of the VLAN. You can find the DB ID in IXP Manager in the VLAN table (select \nVLANs\n from the left hand side menu).\n\n\nprotocol\n is either \n4\n for \nIPv4\n or 6 for \nIPv6\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf either of these are invalid, the API will return with a HTTP 404 response.\n\n\nAnd example of a target in the reponse is:\n\n\n# AS112 Reverse DNS / 185.6.36.6\n+++ vlanint_86_ipv4\nmenu = AS112 Reverse DNS (IPv4)\ntitle =  Peering VLAN #1 :: AS112 Reverse DNS via 185.6.36.6\nprobe = FPing\nhost = 185.6.36.6\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Parameters\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou can optionally POST one or both of the following to change elements of the default template:\n\n\n\n\nlevel\n: the Smokeping level / hierarchy of the target. Defaults to \n+++\n.\n\n\nprobe\n: the probe to use when measuring latency to the target. Defaults for \nFPing\n for IPv4 and \nFPing6\n for IPv6.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of changing these parameters is:\n\n\ncurl --data \nlevel=%2B%2B\nprobe=MyPing\n -X POST \n\\\n\n    -H \nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n \n\\\n\n    -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\n \n\\\n\n    https://ixpexample.com/api/v4/vlan/smokeping/2/4\n\n\n\n\n\nTemplates / Skinning\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou can use \nskinning\n to make changes to the bundled \ndefault\n template or, \npreferably\n, add your own.\n\n\nLet's say you wanted to add your own template called \nmytemplate1\n and your skin is named \nmyskin\n. The best way to proceed is to copy the bundled example:\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\nmkdir -p resources/skins/myskin/api/v4/vlan/smokeping\ncp resources/views/api/v4/vlan/smokeping/default.foil.php resources/skins/myskin/api/v4/vlan/smokeping/mytemplate1.foil.php\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now edit this template as required. The only constraint on the template name is it can only contain characters from the classes \na-z, 0-9, -\n. \nNB:\n do not use uppercase characters.\n\n\nThe following variables are available in the template:\n\n\n\n\n$t-\nvlis\n: array of the VLAN interfaces/targets - it is generated \nby the Repositories\\VlanInterface::getForProto() function\n.\n\n\n$t-\nvlan\n: instance of the \nVlan\n entity object\n.\n\n\n$t-\nprotocol\n: either \n4\n or \n6\n.\n\n\nprobe\n and \nlevel\n as defined above / passed via a post request.\n\n\n\n\nSetting Up Smokeping\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis section explains how to set up Smokeping with IXP Manager. We assume you already have a base install of Smokeping.\n\n\nGenerating / Updating Targets\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAt INEX, we would use a script \nsuch as this one which is bundled with IXP Manager\n to (re)generate our targets by cron and update Smokeping if necessary.\n\n\nTo use this script yourself, you just need to copy it to the appropriate Smokeping server and edit the first few lines:\n\n\nKEY\n=\nmy-ixp-manager-api-key\n\n\nURL\n=\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/vlan/smokeping\n\n\nETCPATH\n=\n/etc/smokeping\n\n\nSMOKEPING\n=\n/usr/bin/smokeping\n\n\nSMOKEPING_RELOAD\n=\n/etc/rc.d/smokeping reload\n\n\nVLANS\n=\n1 2\n\n\nPROTOCOLS\n=\n4 6\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\nKEY\n is your IXP Manager \nAPI key\n.\n\n\nURL\n is the API endpoint as descibed above.\n\n\nETCPATH\n is where the script puts the target files (named \n$ETCPATH/targets-vlan${vlanid}-ipv${proto}.cfg\n)\n\n\nSMOKEPING\n is the Smokeping binary command. Just used to validate the config with \n--check\n before reloading.\n\n\nSMOKEPING_RELOAD\n - the command to reload Smokeping.\n\n\nVLANS\n - space separated list of VLAN DB IDs as described above. You probably only have one of these typically.\n\n\nPROTOCOLS\n - the protocols to generate the configuration for.\n\n\n\n\nThe script iterates over the VLAN IDs and protocols to create the individual configuration files.\n\n\nUsing Targets in Smokeping\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOnce the above target file(s) are created, we can use them in our standard Smokeping configuration file as follows:\n\n\n+ infra_1\nmenu = IXP Infrastructures 1\ntitle = IXP Infrastructures 1\n\n\n++ vlan_1\nmenu = Peering VLAN 1\ntitle = IXP Infra 1 :: Peering VLAN 1\n\n\n@include targets-vlan1-ipv4.cfg\n@include targets-vlan1-ipv6.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\nApache Configuration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou need to be able to configure IXP Manager with the base Smokeping URL such as \nhttp://www.example.com/smokeping\n. This should be the URL to Smokeping that is the standard Smokeping entry page.\n\n\nIXP Manager will add the trailing slash as assume the directory index is configured for the CGI script. Thus you need an Apache configuration such as:\n\n\nScriptAlias /smokeping/smokeping.cgi /usr/lib/cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi\nAlias /smokeping /usr/share/smokeping/www\n\n\nDirectory \n/usr/share/smokeping/www\n\n    Options FollowSymLinks\n    DirectoryIndex smokeping.cgi\n\n/Directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIXP Manager Configuration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe current implementation of Smokeping in IXP Manager is as a \nbridge\n between IXP manager v3 and Grapher - where we hope it will eventually end up.\n\n\nOnce you have configured Smokeping and Apache/web server as above, you really just need to set the following in your IXP Manager \n.env\n file:\n\n\nGRAPHER_SMOKEPING_URL=\nhttp://www.example.com/smokeping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the URL is as you set up in Apache above.\n\n\nThere may be instances where you have multiple VLANs where it is not possible to have a single Smokeping instance graph latency for every VLAN. Particularly as the Smokeping daemon for a given VLAN needs to have an interface / IP address on that VLAN.\n\n\nINEX has such a situation where we have a regional exchange, \nINEX Cork\n, that is located in a different city to the main INEX LANs and IXP Manager. In this situation, you can configure Smokeping URL overrides on a per VLAN basis by creating a file called \n$IXPROOT/config/grapher_smokeping_overrides.php\n which returns an array as follows:\n\n\n?php\n\n\n\nreturn\n \n[\n\n    \n2\n \n=\n \nhttp://www.example.com/smokeping\n,\n\n    \n4\n \n=\n \nhttp://www.example2.com/smokeping\n,\n\n    \n// etc ...\n\n\n];\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the array index (\n2\n and \n4\n in the above example) is the VLAN DB ID as explained above.\n\n\nViewing Smokeping in IXP Manager\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWhen configured correctly, there will be a Smokeping button available in the member drilldown graphs (per port graphs) in both the member and admin sections.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSee \nissue #122\n for a discussion on Ubuntu installation and diagnosing issues in general (relates to IXP Manager v3 but may still be useful).\n\n\nWhen you look at the source HTML of the Smokeping page that IXP Manager generates, you'll see generated Smokeping image URLs like the following:\n\n\nhttps://www.example.com/ixp/smokeping/retrieve-image/ixp/1/scale/3hours/infra/2/vlan/3/vlanint/94/proto/ipv4\n\n\n\n\n\nIXP Manager will call something like\n\n\nfile_get_contents( \nhttps://www.example.com/smokeping/?.....\n )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see these requests to Smokeping in your Smokeping web server log files. Find these and compare them to the URLs that Smokeping itself generates for its own display of the images to ensure you have everything - and especially the Smokeping URL in IXP configuration set up correctly.\n\n\nAlso, try testing these URLs directly on the IXP Manager server via:\n\n\nphp -r \necho file_get_contents( \nhttps://...\n );",

For this we have chosen  Travis-CI  which provides free cloud based CI linked with GitHub for open source projects. Our current build status is:   We won't be aggressively writing tests for the existing codebase but will add tests as appropriate as we continue development.
