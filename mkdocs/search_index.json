            "text": "Requirements\n\n\nIXP Manager tries to stay current in terms of technology. Typically, this means some element of framework refresh(es) every couple of years and other more incremental package upgrades with minor version upgrades. As well as the obvious reasons for this, there is also the requirement to prevent developer apathy - insisting on legacy frameworks and packages that have been EOL'd provides a major stumbling block for bringing on new developers and contributors.\n\n\nThe current requirements for the web application are:\n\n\n\n\na Linux / BSD host.\n\n\nMariaDB / MySQL version 5.5.4 or later.\n\n\nApache / Nginx / etc.\n\n\nPHP \n= 7.0. \nNote that IXP Manager will not run on older versions of PHP.\n\n\nMemcached - optional but highly recommended.\n\n\n\n\nTo complete the installation using the included config/scripts, you will also need to have installed:\n\n\n\n\ngit - distributed revision control system (e.g.: \napt-get install git\n)\n\n\nmemcache extension module for PHP (e.g.: \napt-get install php-memcached\n)\n\n\nSNMP extension module for PHP (e.g.: \napt-get install php7.0-snmp\n)\n\n\nphp7.0-mbstring - may be built into the PHP core\n\n\nphp7.0-xml\n\n\nphp7.0-intl\n\n\nphp7.0-mysql\n\n\nphp7.0-mcrypt\n\n\nphp-rrd\n\n\n\n\nFor completeness, the IXP Manager installation script for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installs:\n\n\nsh\napt-get install apache2 php7.0 php7.0-intl php7.0-mysql php-rrd php7.0-cgi php7.0-cli  \\\n    php7.0-snmp php7.0-curl php7.0-mcrypt php-memcached libapache2-mod-php7.0          \\\n    mysql-server mysql-client php-mysql memcached snmp nodejs nodejs-legacy npm        \\\n    php7.0-mbstring php7.0-xml php-gettext bgpq3 php-memcache unzip php-zip git\n\n\nInstall Composer and Bower\n\n\nIXP Manager uses \nComposer\n to manage its PHP dependencies. First, download a copy of the composer.phar. Once you have the PHAR archive, you can either keep it in your local project directory or move to \n/usr/local/bin\n to use it globally on your system.\n\n\nThe installation script for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installs these via:\n\n\nIXPROOT\n=\n/srv/ixpmanager\n\n# ...\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\n\nEXPECTED_SIGNATURE\n=\n$(\nwget https://composer.github.io/installer.sig -O - -q\n)\n\nphp -r \ncopy(\nhttps://getcomposer.org/installer\n, \ncomposer-setup.php\n);\n\n\nACTUAL_SIGNATURE\n=\n$(\nphp -r \necho hash_file(\nSHA384\n, \ncomposer-setup.php\n);\n)\n\n\n\nif\n \n[\n \n$EXPECTED_SIGNATURE\n \n=\n \n$ACTUAL_SIGNATURE\n \n]\n;\n \nthen\n\n    sudo -u www-data bash -c \nHOME=\n$IXPROOT\n \n cd \n$IXPROOT\n \n php composer-setup.php --quiet\n\n    rm \n$IXPROOT\n/composer-setup.php\n    \n# optional:\n\n    mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer\n\nelse\n\n    \necho\n -e \n\\n\\nERROR: Invalid installer signature for composer installation\n\n    rm \n$IXPROOT\n/composer-setup.php\n    \nexit\n 1\n\nfi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand:\n\n\nnpm install -g bower\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the IXP Manager Source\n\n\nThe code for IXP Manager is maintained on GitHub and the canonical repository is \ninex/IXP-Manager\n.\n\n\nLog into the server where you wish to install IXP Manager. Move to the directory where you wish to store the source (our examples use \n/srv/ixpmanager\n which we refer to as \n$IXPROOT\n). Note that it \nshould not\n be checked out into any web exposed directory (e.g. do not checkout to \n/var/www\n).\n\n\ncd\n /srv\ngit clone https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager.git ixpmanager\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n   \n# /srv/ixpmanager\n\ngit checkout master\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Setup and Dependancies\n\n\nDependencies\n\n\nInstall the required PHP libraries and frontend CSS/JS packages:\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\ncomposer install\nbower install\ncp .env.example .env\nphp artisan key:generate\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Setup\n\n\nUse whatever means you like to create a database and user for IXP Manager. For example:\n\n\nCREATE\n \nDATABASE\n \n`ixp`\n \nCHARACTER\n \nSET\n \n=\n \nutf8mb4\n \nCOLLATE\n \n=\n \nutf8mb4_unicode_ci\n;\n\n\nGRANT\n \nALL\n \nON\n \n`ixp`\n.\n*\n \nTO\n \n`ixp`\n@\n`localhost`\n \nIDENTIFIED\n \nBY\n \npick a password!\n;\n\n\nFLUSH\n \nPRIVILEGES\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen edit \n$IXPROOT/.env\n and set the database options:\n\n\nDB_HOST=localhost\nDB_DATABASE=ixp\nDB_USERNAME=ixp\nDB_PASSWORD=password\n\n\n\n\n\nNow create the database schema:\n\n\nphp artisan doctrine:schema:create\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nEdit \n$IXPROOT/.env\n and review and set/change all parameters.

Typically, this means some element of framework refresh(es) every couple of years and other more incremental package upgrades with minor version upgrades. As well as the obvious reasons for this, there is also the requirement to prevent developer apathy - insisting on legacy frameworks and packages that have been EOL'd provides a major stumbling block for bringing on new developers and contributors.  The current requirements for the web application are:   a Linux / BSD host.  MariaDB / MySQL version 5.5.4 or later.  Apache / Nginx / etc.  PHP  = 7.0.  Note that IXP Manager will not run on older versions of PHP.  Memcached - optional but highly recommended.   To complete the installation using the included config/scripts, you will also need to have installed:   git - distributed revision control system (e.g.:  apt-get install git )  memcache extension module for PHP (e.g.:  apt-get install php-memcached )  SNMP extension module for PHP (e.g.:  apt-get install php7.0-snmp )  php7.0-mbstring - may be built into the PHP core  php7.0-xml  php7.0-intl  php7.0-mysql  php7.0-mcrypt  php-rrd   For completeness, the IXP Manager installation script for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installs:  sh\napt-get install apache2 php7.0 php7.0-intl php7.0-mysql php-rrd php7.0-cgi php7.0-cli  \\\n    php7.0-snmp php7.0-curl php7.0-mcrypt php-memcached libapache2-mod-php7.0          \\\n    mysql-server mysql-client php-mysql memcached snmp nodejs nodejs-legacy npm        \\\n    php7.0-mbstring php7.0-xml php-gettext bgpq3 php-memcache unzip php-zip git",

Doctrine2 caches entities and schema information in Memcached so, after an upgrade, you must restart Memcached.\n\n\nYou can verify and update your schema using the \nartisan\n script. The first action should be validation - here is a working example with no database issues:\n\n\n./artisan doctrine:schema:validate\n\nValidating for default entity manager...\n[Mapping]  OK - The mapping files are correct.\n[Database] OK - The database schema is in sync with the mapping files.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there are issues, you can use the following to show what SQL commands are required to bring your schema into line:\n\n\n./artisan doctrine:schema:update --sql\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you can let Doctrine make the changes for you via:\n\n\n./artisan doctrine:schema:update --force\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctrine2 maintains the entities, proxies and repository classes. Ideally you should never need to do the following on a production installation - as we maintain these files with Git - but if you're developing / testing IXP Manager, you may need to.\n\n\nThe process for updating these files with schema changes / updates is:\n\n\ncd $IXPROOT\n/etc/init.d/memcached restart    # (or as appropriate for your system)\n./artisan doctrine:generate:entities database\n./artisan doctrine:generate:proxies",

For IXP Manager v4, this essentially means pulling from  master .  # move to the directory where you have installed IXP Manager  cd   $IXPROOT  # you should be in the master branch (if not: git checkout master)  # pull the latest code \ngit pull    Install latest required libraries from composer (see notes below):  composer install    Install latest frontend dependencies (see notes below):  # if asked to chose a jquery version, chose the latest / highest version offered \nbower install    Restart Memcached. Do not forget / skip this step!  systemctl restart memcached.service    Update the database schema:  # review / sanity check first: \n./artisan doctrine:schema:update --sql # If in doubt, take a mysqldump of your database first.  # migrate: \n./artisan doctrine:schema:update --force    Restart Memcached (yes, again).

The first action should be validation - here is a working example with no database issues:  ./artisan doctrine:schema:validate\n\nValidating for default entity manager...\n[Mapping]  OK - The mapping files are correct.\n[Database] OK - The database schema is in sync with the mapping files.  If there are issues, you can use the following to show what SQL commands are required to bring your schema into line:  ./artisan doctrine:schema:update --sql  And you can let Doctrine make the changes for you via:  ./artisan doctrine:schema:update --force  Doctrine2 maintains the entities, proxies and repository classes. Ideally you should never need to do the following on a production installation - as we maintain these files with Git - but if you're developing / testing IXP Manager, you may need to.

You can get this, for example, by hovering over the edit action in the VLAN listing in IXP Manager and finding the number in the URL.\n\n\nprotocol\n is either \n4\n (IPv4) or \n6\n (IPv6). Any other value will lead to a runtime exception.\n\n\nwe have currently defined three types which are used for grouping routers in the UI and for other selection purposes:\n\n\nRC\n - route collector;\n\n\nRS\n - route server;\n\n\nAS112\n - an AS112 BGP peer (see \nINEX's AS112 documentation\n as an example).\n\n\nname\n - name / description of the router's purpose.\n\n\nshortname\n - used in dropdowns or other space constrained areas where \nname\n may be too long.\n\n\nrouter_id\n - the router's BGP ID (e.g. \n192.0.2.8\n).\n\n\npeering_ip\n - the IPv4/6 address that this router initiates BGP peering sessions from.\n\n\nasn\n - the router's AS number.\n\n\nsoftware\n - there is no specific use for this as yet.\n\n\nmgmt_ip\n - the IP to address this server / router at for management functions such as Nagios monitoring.\n\n\napi\n and \napi_type\n - the API end point for this server/router. The only use case for this so far is for the built-in \nlooking glass\n functionality via \nBirdseye\n.\n\n\nlg_access\n - who should be allow access the looking glass. One of:\n\n\nAUTH_PUBLIC\n - publicly available to all;\n\n\nAUTH_CUSTUSER\n - must be logged into IXP Manager as any user;\n\n\nAUTH_SUPERUSER\n - must be logged into IXP Manager as an administrator (no customer access).\n\n\nquarantine\n - a flag to indicate if this router is part of the IXP's quarantine / test infrastructure. For example, INEX runs two parallel route collectors: one quarantine and one production. When customers have issues or are being provisioned, they are placed in the quarantine LAN and we can examine BGP announcements safely on the non-production quarantine devices. When a router is marked as quarantine, it is only visible in looking glass dropdowns to customers who also have a port in quarantine (physical interface status).\n\n\nbgp_lc\n - a flag to indicate if the router supports \nRFC8092\n / \nlarge BGP communities\n.\n\n\ntemplate\n - the template to use to generate the configuration. See stock examples \nhere\n (and note that \nskinning\n is supported).\n\n\n\n\nTypically your \nrouters.php\n file would hold multiple such entries. It is our intention to move this into the UI and database.\n\n\nGeneration Overview\n\n\nThe simplest configuration to generate is the route collector configuration. A route collector is an IXP router which serves only to \naccept all routes and export no routes\n. It is used for problem diagnosis, to aid customer monitoring and for looking glasses (see \nINEX's here\n.\n\n\nThe \nstandard configuration\n simply pulls in a fairly standard header (sets up router ID, listening address and - for the collector at least - some unused filters) and creates a session for all customer routers on the given VLAN (see \nvlan_id\n above).\n\n\nIn the above example, the route handle is the array's associative key (\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n) and - for the given router handle - the configuration can be generated via:\n\n\n# The key is generated in IXP Manager via the top right menu: *My Account -\n API Keys*\nKEY=\nyour-admin-ixp-manager-api-key\n\n# The base URL of your IXP Manager install plus: \napi/v4/router/gen_config\n\nURL=\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/gen_config\n\n# The handle is the PHP associative key from `config/routers.php` as described above\nHANDLE=\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n\n# Then the complete URL is formed as:\ncurl --fail -s -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: ${KEY}\n ${URL}/${HANDLE} \n${HANDLE}.conf\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigurations for the route server and AS112 templates can be configured just as easily. The stock templates for both are secure and well tested and can be used by setting the \ntemplate\n element of the router configuration above to the following:\n\n\n\n\nAS112: \n'api/v4/router/as112/bird/standard'\n\n\nRoute Server: \n'api/v4/router/server/bird/standard'\n\n\n\n\nWe also provide sample scripts for automating the re-configuration of these services by cron. See the \n-v4\n scripts \nin this directory\n. These are quite robust and have been in production for ~3 years at INEX (as of Jan 2017).\n\n\nRoute Servers\n\n\nNormally on a peering exchange, all connected parties will establish bilateral peering relationships with each other customer connected to the exchange. As the number of connected parties increases, it becomes increasingly more difficult to manage peering relationships with customers of the exchange.\n\n\nHowever, by using a route servers for peering relationships, the number of BGP sessions per router stays at two: one for each route server (assuming a resilient set up). Clearly this is a more sustainable way of maintaining IXP peering relationships with a large number of participants.\n\n\nYou will have learnt above how to automatically generate route server configurations. This section goes into a bit more specific detail on INEX's route server configuration (shipped with IXP Manager) and why it's safe to use.\n\n\nThe features of the route server configurations that we generate include:\n\n\n\n\nfull prefix filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required);\n\n\nfull origin ASN filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required);\n\n\nin all cases, prefix filtering for IPv4 and v6 based on the IANA special purpose registries (also known as bogon lists);\n\n\nensuring next hop is the neighbor address to ensure no next hop hijacking;\n\n\nmax prefix limits;\n\n\nmultiple VLAN interfaces for a single member supported;\n\n\nlarge BGP communities supported;\n\n\na decade of production use and experience.\n\n\n\n\nThere are \nsome old notes on route server testing here\n which may also be useful.\n\n\nIRRDB Prefixes and ASN Filtering\n\n\nIXP Manager can maintain a list of member route:/route6: prefixes and origin ASNs as registered in IRRDBs in its database and then use these to, for example, generate strict inbound filters on route servers.\n\n\nPrerequisite:\n you need to have set up some IRRDB sources (e.g. RIPE's whois service) under the \nIXP Admin Actions / IRRDB Configuration\n on the left hand side menu. There is a database seeder to install some to start you off via the following (but thius is typically done during installation):\n\n\n./artisan db:seed --class=IRRDBs\n\n\n\n\n\nBGPQ3 is a very easy and fast way of querying IRRDBs. You first need to install this on your system. Then configure the path to it in \nconfig/ixp_tools.php\n. If you have not used this file before, you'll need to create your own local copy as follows:\n\n\ncp config/config/ixp_tools.php.dist config/config/ixp_tools.php\n\n\n\n\n\nThen set the full call path for \nbgpq3\n in this file:\n\n\n?php\n\n\n  \nirrdb\n \n=\n \n[\n\n        \nbgpq\n \n=\n \n[\n\n            \npath\n \n=\n \n/path/to/bgpq3\n,\n\n        \n],\n\n    \n],\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo populate (and update) your local IRRDB, run the following commands (changing the path as appropriate):\n\n\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-prefix-db\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-asn-db\n\n\n\n\n\nThese should be added to cron to run ~once per day (using the --quiet flag).\n\n\nThere are four levels of verbosity:\n\n\n\n\n-quiet\n: no output unless there's an error / issue.\n\n\nno option: simple stats on each customer's update results.\n\n\n-vv\n: include per customer and overall timings (database, processing and network).\n\n\n-vvv\n (debug): show prefixes/ASNs added remove also.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also specify a specific customer to update (rather than all) with an additional free form parameter. The database is searched for a matching customer in the order: customer ASN; customer ID (database primary key); and customer shortname. E.g.:\n\n\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-prefix-db 64511\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IRRDB update commands will:\n\n\n\n\niterate over all route server client customers for IPv4 and IPv6 (unless a specific customer is specified);\n\n\nuse the appropriate AS macro or ASN;\n\n\nquery the RADB against the appropriate source set for that customer;\n\n\ncompare prefixes(/ASNs) in the database already (if any) against RADB and insert / delete as appropriate;\n\n\nvalidate the prefix for proper CIDR notation before database inserts;\n\n\nupdate the last_seen time for all prefixes(/ASNs) for that customer;\n\n\n\n\nWe use transactions to update the database so, even in the middle of a refresh, a full set of prefixes for all customers will still be available.\n\n\nNote that our current implementation only queries RADB as BGPQ3 does not support the RIPE whois protocol.\n Our version will however set the RADB source database according to the member's stated IRRDB database as set on the customer add / edit page - so, for customer's registered with the RIPE IRRDB, the RIPE database of RADB is queried.",

You can get this, for example, by hovering over the edit action in the VLAN listing in IXP Manager and finding the number in the URL.  protocol  is either  4  (IPv4) or  6  (IPv6). Any other value will lead to a runtime exception.  we have currently defined three types which are used for grouping routers in the UI and for other selection purposes:  RC  - route collector;  RS  - route server;  AS112  - an AS112 BGP peer (see  INEX's AS112 documentation  as an example).  name  - name / description of the router's purpose.  shortname  - used in dropdowns or other space constrained areas where  name  may be too long.  router_id  - the router's BGP ID (e.g.  192.0.2.8 ).  peering_ip  - the IPv4/6 address that this router initiates BGP peering sessions from.  asn  - the router's AS number.  software  - there is no specific use for this as yet.  mgmt_ip  - the IP to address this server / router at for management functions such as Nagios monitoring.  api  and  api_type  - the API end point for this server/router. The only use case for this so far is for the built-in  looking glass  functionality via  Birdseye .  lg_access  - who should be allow access the looking glass. One of:  AUTH_PUBLIC  - publicly available to all;  AUTH_CUSTUSER  - must be logged into IXP Manager as any user;  AUTH_SUPERUSER  - must be logged into IXP Manager as an administrator (no customer access).  quarantine  - a flag to indicate if this router is part of the IXP's quarantine / test infrastructure. For example, INEX runs two parallel route collectors: one quarantine and one production. When customers have issues or are being provisioned, they are placed in the quarantine LAN and we can examine BGP announcements safely on the non-production quarantine devices. When a router is marked as quarantine, it is only visible in looking glass dropdowns to customers who also have a port in quarantine (physical interface status).  bgp_lc  - a flag to indicate if the router supports  RFC8092  /  large BGP communities .  template  - the template to use to generate the configuration.

            "text": "Patch Panels / Cross Connects\n\n\nOne of the more difficult things for an IXP to manage is the sheer volume of patch panels / cross connects they need to manage. We have approached the issue a number of times in IXP Manger but abandoned the attempt every time. Typically our original solutions were over-engineered where all we really needed was something which could replace a spreadsheet per panel.\n\n\nWe believe we have now developed a feature complete and useful means of managing patch panels and associated cross connects.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nAdd / edit patch panels  (which includes cable and connector types).\n\n\nList associated patch panel ports which includes:\n\n\ntheir state (such as available / prewired, awaiting cross connect, connected, awaiting cease, reserved, broken).\n\n\nassociated customer and/or switchport.\n\n\nco-location provider's circuit reference.\n\n\ninternal ticket references.\n\n\nTransition ports from available / prewired to awaiting x-connect to connected to awaiting cease to ceased and then available again.\n\n\nCustomer view of their cross connects.\n\n\nPublic (visible to customers) and private notes per cross connect.\n\n\nAttach public and private files to cross connects (such as test results, completion documents, order forms, etc).\n\n\nMaintain complete history of a patch panel port.\n\n\nGenerate and email LoAs (as PDF) with a URL verification function for co-location providers.\n\n\nGenerate emails for connection and cease requests as well as an email providing full customer view of a cross connect.\n\n\nTypically fibre ports are \nduplex\n ports but there is a growing use of BiDi optics meaning simplex ports. Our implementation treats all ports as simplex but you can mark it as duplex and set its partner port.\n\n\n\n\nDuplex Fibre Ports\n\n\nWe suggest adding fibre ports as two ports per duplex port. I.e. if your patch panel has 12 duplex ports, enter this as 24 ports. When allocating ports later, you can set it as a duplex port and select its \npartner / slave port\n. This will future proof your patch panels for the growing use of bidi optics and other simplex based xWDM fibre solutions.\n\n\nFrom our experience, duplex fibre ports are often identified as their individual strands. For example, \nduplex port 5\n would be referenced as \nF9/F10\n.\n\n\nYour mileage may vary on this but we need to allow this flexibility to cover both use-cases. You always have options however:\n\n\n\n\nyou can change the presentation of how these ports are referenced externally by \nskinning\n the templates.\n\n\nyou have the option to edit emails before they are sent to also present this as you wish.\n\n\nyou can chose to treat duplex ports as single ports rather than doubling them up.\n\n\nwhen you have duplex ports on a patch panel, IXP Manager will provide a duplex view by default with a CSS-based toggle to reveal the typical partner ports.\n\n\nif you think IXP Manager can make this easier, please talk to us. \nBut we cannot cover every use case programatically. We've opted to allow flexibility rather than dictate a particular format.\n\n\n\n\nAdding a Patch Panel\n\n\nThe following image shows a typical \nadd a new patch panel\n form (as of v4.3). You'll note that clicking \nHelp\n provides detailed context aware help messages.\n\n\n\n\nMost of this is self-explanatory but:\n\n\n\n\nBy default, we set the \nColocation Reference\n to the \nPatch Panel Name\n. We are not sure it's a good idea for IXPs to create a second name different to the co-location provider's but this option is available to you. \nSeriously, think about what you are doing here - more references means more confusion!\n The cabinet and cable type is displayed in the list of patch panels so even with obscure data centre references, it should be easy to find what you need.\n\n\nLocation Notes\n: Data centre / co-location providers do a lot of weird, wonderful and strange things! They provide multiple references for a single patch panel (IXP cabinet, MMR, etc.), they get taken over and re-reference everything or even provide no discernable reference. The field is a freetext field that will be included (and parsed as Markdown) in all emails generated by IXP Manager to help you help them identify a patch panel!\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to that, we will also use a cabinets \nU's are counted from top/bottom\n, and a patch panel's \nU position\n and \nmounted at front/rear\n to also create a location description.\n\n When setting the \nNumber of Ports\n, ensure you count duplex fibre ports as \ntwo ports\n. So 12 duplex fibre ports would be entered as 24. When editing a patch panel, this input field represents the number of additional ports you want to add to a patch panel and thus defaults to 0 in that situation.\n\n \nPort Name Prefix\n: This is an optional field intended for use on fibre patch panels. As an example, you may wish to prefix individual fibre strands in a duplex port with F which would mean the name of a duplex port would be displayed as F1/F2.\n* \nChargeable\n: Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. Setting this only sets the default option when allocating ports to members later. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other.\n\n\nFiltering Patch Panel Ports\n\n\nQuite often, all you are looking for is a free in a particular location (data centre) or cabinet of a particular cable type (UTP / SMF / etc.).\n\n\nIXP Manager makes this easy from the \nPatch Panels\n page via the top right button labeled \nFilter Options\n. When clicked, this yields an advanced search as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCabinets auto-fills when you chose (or change) a location.\n\n\nPatch Panel Port States\n\n\nA patch panel port can have the following states:\n\n\n\n\nAvailable\n: The port is free and available for use.\n\n\nPrewired\n: This is equivalent to available but it means the port is prewired to a given switchport (you set the port when setting the prewired status). This is useful for IXPs that prewire a bunch of ports to avoid remote hands costs / data centre visits.\n\n\nAwaiting Xconnect\n: Port has been assigned to a member and we are awaiting the co-location provider to install the cross connect. In this state, context aware actions such as emailing connection requests, LoA generation and \nSet Connected\n are all available.\n\n\nConnected\n: Connected and in use.\n\n\nAwaiting Cease\n: This connection is no longer required and we are awaiting the end user / co-location provider to cease the connection.\n\n\nCeased\n: You will never see a ceased state. When a cross connect is marked as ceased, it's current state is archived (for history, include files) and the port is reset to \nAvailable\n. We do not revert to \nPrewired\n but an information message is shown to the user to hint this.\n\n\nReserved\n: Useful to mark particular ports as \noff limits\n for whatever reason.\n\n\nBroken\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\nFree / Available Ports\n\n\nIXP Manager will colour ports in the \nAvailable\n, \nPrewired\n and \nAwaiting Cease\n states are green allowing an easy visual indication of available ports.\n\n\nPatch Panel Port Lifecycle\n\n\nPatch panel ports start as either \navailable\n or \nprewired\n. The context menu in these states is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnset Prewired\n is available as this port has a \nPrewired\n status. Clicking this reverts it to plain \nAvailable\n and disassociates it from the prewired port.\n\n\nEdit Note...\n is always available and provides a pop up to edit public and private notes associated with the port (current lifecycle - ceased ports have their notes at that time archived and cleared).\n\n\n\n\nThe main lifecycle option here is \nAllocate\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n: A one line short description to be shown in the list of patch panel ports. Just enough to help explain the ports purpose. Detailed information should be placed in the notes section. Can also be used to explain a reserved / broken / other port. Note that this is parsed as Markdown. \nNB:\n A description is discouraged for customer ports connected to a switch. The customer name and switch port are the description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColocation Circuit Reference\n: this is the reference provided by the colocation provider to uniquely reference this cross connect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTicket Reference(s)\n: This is a free text field to be used by IXPs as they wish. The intended use is to enter helpdesk ticket references that relate to this cross connect order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuplex connection?\n: Clicking this allows you to select the slave port for duplex connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch / Switch Port\n / \nCustomer\n: You have a number of options when allocating a port:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the port is pre-wired then the switch / switch port will be set here.\n\n\n\n\nIf you chose a switch port which has been allocated to a customer, then this patch panel port will also be allocated to that customer. The backend logic will detect if this is the case and update the customer field.\n\n\nConversely, if you chose a customer first, the switch / switch port dropdowns will be populated with only that customer's assigned ports.\n\n\nSometimes you will get cross connects that are not intended to be connected to peering switches (e.g. connections to co-located customer equipment, IXP metro connections, etc.). In these cases, just select the customer (and if it's the IXP itself, select the IXP customer) and leave switch / switch port unselected.\n\n\n\n\nIf you need to reset these fields, just click either of the Reset button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatch Panel Port Status\n: when allocating a port, this will allow you to set the state to \nAwaiting Xconnect\n or \nConnected\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Interface Status\n: this is not depicted above. If the selected switch port has already been assigned to a customer by way of a physical interface, you will have the option to update this here also.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic\n and \nPrivate Notes\n: Public notes are available to the customer. Both fields are interpreted as Markdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChargeable\n: Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other. How individual IXPs use this is up to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Use\n: Marks the port as used by the IXP itself. E.g. metro connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwned By\n: Useful indication for billing and cease requests. Should represent the contractural owner of the cross connect. One of: Customer, IXP, Service Provider, Data Centre, Other. \nService Provider\n might be a metro provider where they ordered the cross connect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce a port is allocated, it enters the \nAwaiting XConnect\n / \nConnected\n state and there are additional context menu options available:\n\n\n\n\nThe three lifecycle actions are:\n\n\n\n\nSet Connected\n: updates the status (and allows you to add public/private notes). You next action after this should be \nEmail - Connect\n.\n\n\nSet Awaiting Cease\n: mark the port and pending disconnection. Your next action after this should be \nEmail - Cease\n.\n\n\nSet Ceased\n: this is a \ntransitive state\n in that it doesn't \nstick\n. When you mark a patch panel as ceased, the existing details (including files and notes) are archived as part of the port's history and then port is then cleared and made available again.\n\n\n\n\nFile Attachments\n\n\nOver the lifetime of a cross connect - and particularly when it is being ordered, there may be files exchanges between you and your customers or the colocation provider. These can be added to the patch panel port via the \nAttach File...\n option.\n\n\nThe dialog will dynamically determine the maximum file upload size based on your PHP settings. To alter this, change the following in your server's appropriate \nphp.ini\n:\n\n\n; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.\nupload_max_filesize = 40M\n\n; Must be greater than or equal to upload_max_filesize\npost_max_size = 40M\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease search the internet for further help as this is outside the scope of IXP Manager documentation.\n\n\nThe following features apply to file attachments:\n\n\n\n\nthey are archived along with the port history when a cross connect is ceased.\n\n\nthey are stored under \n$IXPROOT/storage/files/ppp\n.\n\n\ntwo files of the same name cannot be uploaded for a single patch panel port.\n\n\nthey can be marked as public or private:\n\n\npublic files are accessible to the customer through their own dashboard.\n\n\npublic files are attached to the \nEmail - Information\n email.\n\n\n\n\nLoA Generation\n\n\nMany co-location providers will not accept a cross connect order without a LoA \n(Letter of Agency/Authority)\n from the party to whom the cross connect is to be delivered (typically the IXP).\n\n\nIXP Manager will generate a PDF LoA to download or include in the emails it generates for you. Here is an example:\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to \nskin\n this yourself to change the legalese, address and contact details and potentially add a logo. See the version INEX uses \nhere\n (which includes and embedded PNG logo).\n\n\nNote that \nDompdf\n is used to turn the HTML template into a PDF and it has some restrictions.\n\n\nYou have two options for generating LoAs (without having IXP Manager email them):\n\n\n\n\nDownload PDF\n: downloads the PDF via your browser.\n\n\nView PDF\n: displays the PDF LoA in your browser (where browser supports it).\n\n\n\n\nLoA Verification\n\n\nThe stock LoA template (and INEX's version) includes a link that allows co-location browsers to click on to verify its veracity.\n\n\nOn successful verification, the end user sees:\n\n\n\n\nEmail Generation\n\n\nIXP Manager allows you to send four emails related to patch panels / cross connects (port status dependent). These are listed below. The Email editor looks as follows:\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\n\n\n\nthe option to attach a PDF LoA is a checkbox.\n\n\nthe email is written in Markdown with a preview available. The email is sent as both HTML (from the Markdown) and the plaintext version.\n\n\n\n\nThe four email templates available are:\n\n\n\n\nEmail - Connect\n: Email the customer a request to order a cross connect to the given demarcation points. A LoA is attached as a PDF by default unless you uncheck the box in the email editor.\n\n\nEmail - Cease\n: Email the customer a request to cease a cross connect.\n\n\nEmail - Information\n: Email the customer all details on file about a cross connect. We often get requests for this at INEX and this simplifies the process. The generated email includes:\n\n\nthe standard details regarding port and co-location reference;\n\n\npublic notes;\n\n\npublic files as attachments.\n\n\nEmail - LoA\n: Email a LoA to the customer as attached as a PDF. This is similar to \nEmail - Connect\n but it is more reflective of a typical response to a second request for a LoA.\n\n\n\n\nAll email templates can be \nskinned\n for your own needs. See INEX's example skins \nhere\n.\n\n\nViewing Patch Panel Details and Archives\n\n\nEach patch panel port row has the following button:\n\n\n\n\nThe number in the badge indicates how many historical records are available.\n\n\nClicking on the button yields the following view screen:\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment History\n\n\nThe Patch Panels functionality was developed during Q1 2017 and added in March 2017.

This will future proof your patch panels for the growing use of bidi optics and other simplex based xWDM fibre solutions.  From our experience, duplex fibre ports are often identified as their individual strands. For example,  duplex port 5  would be referenced as  F9/F10 .  Your mileage may vary on this but we need to allow this flexibility to cover both use-cases. You always have options however:   you can change the presentation of how these ports are referenced externally by  skinning  the templates.  you have the option to edit emails before they are sent to also present this as you wish.  you can chose to treat duplex ports as single ports rather than doubling them up.  when you have duplex ports on a patch panel, IXP Manager will provide a duplex view by default with a CSS-based toggle to reveal the typical partner ports.  if you think IXP Manager can make this easier, please talk to us.

We ship with this set as \n\"dummy\"\n so you can see sample graphs working out of the box.\n\n\ncache\n - as the industry standard is to graph at 5min intervals, the cache settings do not regenerate / reload / reprocess log / rrd / image files if we have cached them and they are less than 5mins old. This is enabled by default which is the recommended setting.\n\n\n\n\nBackend specific configuration and set-up instructions can be found in their own sections.\n\n\nGrapher Backends\n\n\nMrtg\n\n\nMRTG is a particularly efficient SNMP poller as, irrespective of how many times an interface is referenced for different graphs, it is only polled once per run.\n\n\nPer-second graphs are generated for bits, packets, errors, discards and broadcasts at 5min intervals. IXP Manager's Grapher system can use MRTG to poll switches and create traffic graphs for:\n\n\n\n\nAggregate IXP and Infrastructure Graphs\n\n\n\n\nThe MRTG script creates aggregate graphs for the entire IXP as well as per-infrastructure graphs. These graphs are available from the \nStatistics\n menu under \nOverall Peering Graphs\n. Also, the graphs on the admin dashboard are the monthly versions of these and will appear on the dashboard when configured as above.\n\n\n\n\nSwitch Aggregate Graphs\n\n\n\n\nThese are defined and built automatically from the switches you have defined. These graphs are the aggregate of all peering ports. These graphs are available from the \nStatistics\n menu under \nSwitch Aggregate Graphs\n.\n\n\n\n\nInter-Switch / Trunk Graphs\n\n\n\n\nIXP Manager does not currently support a frontend means of creating these definitions (but, as of March 2017, it is being worked on). For now, we do it manually via the \nIXP Manager v3 way\n.\n\n\nThese graphs will be available in the \nStatistics\n menu under \nInter-Switch / PoP Graphs\n.\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Graphs\n\n\n\n\nMRTG creates per port, per LAG and aggregate graphs for each member / customer.\n\n\nMRTG Setup and Configuration\n\n\nYou need to install some basic packages for MRTG to work - on Ubuntu for example, install:\n\n\napt-get install libconfig-general-perl libnetaddr-ip-perl mrtg\n\n\n\n\n\nYou also need a folder to store all MRTG files. For example:\n\n\nmkdir -p /srv/mrtg\n\n\n\n\n\nIn your `.env, you need to set the following options:\n\n\n# the database type to use - either log or rrd\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_DBTYPE=\nrrd\n\n# where to store log/rrd/png files as created above. This is from the perspective\n# of the mrtg daemon so should also be local\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_WORKDIR=\n/tmp\n\n# where to find the WORKDIR above from IXP Manager\ns perspective. This can be a\n# local directory or a URL to remote web server\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_LOGDIR=\nhttp://collector.example.com/mrtg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now generate a MRTG configuration by executing a command such as:\n\n\n# output to stdout:\n\n./artisan grapher:generate-configuration -B mrtg\n\n# output to a named file\n\n./artisan grapher:generate-configuration -B mrtg -O /tmp/mrtg.cfg.candidate\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could also combine a syntax check before putting the resultant file live. Here's a complete example that could be run via cron:\n\n\n#! /bin/sh\n\n\n\nAPPLICATION_PATH\n=\n/srv/ixp\n\n\n# Synchronise configuration files\n\n\n${\nAPPLICATION_PATH\n}\n/artisan grapher:generate-configuration -B mrtg -O /tmp/mrtg.cfg.candidate\n\n/usr/bin/mrtg --check /tmp/mrtg.cfg.candidate                 \n\\\n\n    \n /bin/mv /tmp/mrtg.cfg.candidate /etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your MRTG collector is on a different server, you could use a script such as the following to safely update MRTG:\n\n\n#! /bin/bash\n\n\ncurl --fail -s -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: your_api_key\n \n\\\n\n    https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/grapher/mrtg-config \n/etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg.\n$$\n\n\n\nif\n \n[[\n \n$?\n -ne \n0\n \n]]\n;\n \nthen\n\n    \necho\n \nWARNING: COULD NOT FETCH UP TO DATE MRTG CONFIGURATION!\n\n    \nexit\n -1\n\nfi\n\n\n\ncd\n /etc/mrtg\n\ncat mrtg.cfg    \n|\n egrep -v \n^#.*$\n \n|\n egrep -v \n^[ ]+Based on configuration last generated by.*$\n \nmrtg.cfg.filtered\ncat mrtg.cfg.\n$$\n \n|\n egrep -v \n^#.*$\n \n|\n egrep -v \n^[ ]+Based on configuration last generated by.*$\n \nmrtg.cfg.\n$$\n.filtered\ndiff mrtg.cfg.filtered mrtg.cfg.\n$$\n.filtered \n/dev/null\n\nDIFF\n=\n$?\n\n\nrm mrtg.cfg.filtered\nrm mrtg.cfg.\n$$\n.filtered\n\n\nif\n \n[[\n \n$DIFF\n -eq \n0\n \n]]\n;\n \nthen\n\n    rm mrtg.cfg.\n$$\n\n    \nexit\n 0\n\nfi\n\n\n/usr/local/bin/mrtg --check /etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg.\n$$\n                 \n\\\n\n    \n /bin/mv /etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg.\n$$\n /etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg \n\\\n\n    \n /etc/rc.d/mrtg_daemon restart \n /dev/null 2\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that our header template starts MRTG as a daemon. On FreeBSD, MRTG comes with an initd script by default and you can kick it off on boot with something like the following in rc.conf:\n\n\nmrtg_daemon_enable=\nYES\n\nmrtg_daemon_config=\n/etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, on Ubuntu it does not but it comes with a /etc/cron.d/mrtg file which kicks it off every five minutes (it will daemonise the first time and further cron jobs will have no effect). If you use this method, you will need to have your periodic update script restart / stop the daemon when the configuration changes (as demonstrated in the above script).\n\n\nTo start and stop it via standard initd scripts on Ubuntu, use \nan initd script such as this\n  (\nsource\n:\n\n\ncp $APPLICATION_PATH/tools/runtime/mrtg/ubuntu-mrtg-initd /etc/init.d/mrtg\nchmod +x /etc/init.d/mrtg\nupdate-rc.d mrtg defaults\n/etc/init.d/mrtg start\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember to disable the default cron job for MRTG on Ubuntu!\n\n\nCustomising the Configuration\n\n\nAn example of how to customise the MRTG configuration \ncan be found in the skinning documenation\n.\n\n\nInserting Traffic Data Into the Database / Reporting Emails\n\n\nThe MRTG backend inserts daily summaries into MySQL for reporting.

For example, INEX runs two parallel route collectors: one quarantine and one production. When customers have issues or are being provisioned, they are placed in the quarantine LAN and we can examine BGP announcements safely on the non-production quarantine devices.

See stock examples \nhere\n (and note that \nskinning\n is supported).\n\n\n\n\nTypically your \nrouters.php\n file would hold multiple such entries. It is our intention to move this into the UI and database.\n\n\nGeneration Overview\n\n\nThe simplest configuration to generate is the route collector configuration. A route collector is an IXP router which serves only to \naccept all routes and export no routes\n. It is used for problem diagnosis, to aid customer monitoring and for looking glasses (see \nINEX's here\n.\n\n\nThe \nstandard configuration\n simply pulls in a fairly standard header (sets up router ID, listening address and - for the collector at least - some unused filters) and creates a session for all customer routers on the given VLAN (see \nvlan_id\n above).\n\n\nIn the above example, the route handle is the array's associative key (\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n) and - for the given router handle - the configuration can be generated via:\n\n\n# The key is generated in IXP Manager via the top right menu: *My Account -\n API Keys*\nKEY=\nyour-admin-ixp-manager-api-key\n\n# The base URL of your IXP Manager install plus: \napi/v4/router/gen_config\n\nURL=\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/gen_config\n\n# The handle is the PHP associative key from `config/routers.php` as described above\nHANDLE=\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n\n# Then the complete URL is formed as:\ncurl --fail -s -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: ${KEY}\n ${URL}/${HANDLE} \n${HANDLE}.conf\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigurations for the route server and AS112 templates can be configured just as easily. The stock templates for both are secure and well tested and can be used by setting the \ntemplate\n element of the router configuration above to the following:\n\n\n\n\nAS112: \n'api/v4/router/as112/bird/standard'\n\n\nRoute Server: \n'api/v4/router/server/bird/standard'\n\n\n\n\nWe also provide sample scripts for automating the re-configuration of these services by cron. See the \n-v4\n scripts \nin this directory\n. These are quite robust and have been in production for ~3 years at INEX (as of Jan 2017).\n\n\nRoute Servers\n\n\nNormally on a peering exchange, all connected parties will establish bilateral peering relationships with each other customer connected to the exchange. As the number of connected parties increases, it becomes increasingly more difficult to manage peering relationships with customers of the exchange.\n\n\nHowever, by using a route servers for peering relationships, the number of BGP sessions per router stays at two: one for each route server (assuming a resilient set up). Clearly this is a more sustainable way of maintaining IXP peering relationships with a large number of participants.\n\n\nYou will have learnt above how to automatically generate route server configurations. This section goes into a bit more specific detail on INEX's route server configuration (shipped with IXP Manager) and why it's safe to use.\n\n\nThe features of the route server configurations that we generate include:\n\n\n\n\nfull prefix filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required);\n\n\nfull origin ASN filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required);\n\n\nin all cases, prefix filtering for IPv4 and v6 based on the IANA special purpose registries (also known as bogon lists);\n\n\nensuring next hop is the neighbor address to ensure no next hop hijacking;\n\n\nmax prefix limits;\n\n\nmultiple VLAN interfaces for a single member supported;\n\n\nlarge BGP communities supported;\n\n\na decade of production use and experience.\n\n\n\n\nThere are \nsome old notes on route server testing here\n which may also be useful.\n\n\nIRRDB Prefixes and ASN Filtering\n\n\nIXP Manager can maintain a list of member route:/route6: prefixes and origin ASNs as registered in IRRDBs in its database and then use these to, for example, generate strict inbound filters on route servers.\n\n\nPrerequisite:\n you need to have set up some IRRDB sources (e.g. RIPE's whois service) under the \nIXP Admin Actions / IRRDB Configuration\n on the left hand side menu. There is a database seeder to install some to start you off via the following (but thius is typically done during installation):\n\n\n./artisan db:seed --class=IRRDBs\n\n\n\n\n\nBGPQ3 is a very easy and fast way of querying IRRDBs. You first need to install this on your system. Then configure the path to it in \nconfig/ixp_tools.php\n. If you have not used this file before, you'll need to create your own local copy as follows:\n\n\ncp config/config/ixp_tools.php.dist config/config/ixp_tools.php\n\n\n\n\n\nThen set the full call path for \nbgpq3\n in this file:\n\n\n?php\n\n\n  \nirrdb\n \n=\n \n[\n\n        \nbgpq\n \n=\n \n[\n\n            \npath\n \n=\n \n/path/to/bgpq3\n,\n\n        \n],\n\n    \n],\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo populate (and update) your local IRRDB, run the following commands (changing the path as appropriate):\n\n\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-prefix-db\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-asn-db\n\n\n\n\n\nThese should be added to cron to run ~once per day (using the --quiet flag).\n\n\nThere are four levels of verbosity:\n\n\n\n\n-quiet\n: no output unless there's an error / issue.\n\n\nno option: simple stats on each customer's update results.\n\n\n-vv\n: include per customer and overall timings (database, processing and network).\n\n\n-vvv\n (debug): show prefixes/ASNs added remove also.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also specify a specific customer to update (rather than all) with an additional free form parameter. The database is searched for a matching customer in the order: customer ASN; customer ID (database primary key); and customer shortname. E.g.:\n\n\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-prefix-db 64511\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IRRDB update commands will:\n\n\n\n\niterate over all route server client customers for IPv4 and IPv6 (unless a specific customer is specified);\n\n\nuse the appropriate AS macro or ASN;\n\n\nquery the RADB against the appropriate source set for that customer;\n\n\ncompare prefixes(/ASNs) in the database already (if any) against RADB and insert / delete as appropriate;\n\n\nvalidate the prefix for proper CIDR notation before database inserts;\n\n\nupdate the last_seen time for all prefixes(/ASNs) for that customer;\n\n\n\n\nWe use transactions to update the database so, even in the middle of a refresh, a full set of prefixes for all customers will still be available.\n\n\nNote that our current implementation only queries RADB as BGPQ3 does not support the RIPE whois protocol.\n Our version will however set the RADB source database according to the member's stated IRRDB database as set on the customer add / edit page - so, for customer's registered with the RIPE IRRDB, the RIPE database of RADB is queried.",

We have a script,  update-l2database.pl , for this. To set it up (using Ubuntu as an example=), proceed as below. We are in the process of trying to reduce the reliance on the perl library and direct database access.

Any mailing list members that are added separately without a matching user in IXP Manager are not interfered with.\n\n\nConfiguring Available Mailing Lists\n\n\nThere is a sample configuration file which you need to copy as follows:\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\ncp config/mailinglists.php.dist config/mailinglists.php\n\n\n\n\n\nYou then need to edit this file as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the mailing list functionality by setting this to true:\n\n\n// Set the following to \ntrue\n to enable mailing list functionality:\n\n\nenabled\n =\n true,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this is not set to true, the user will not be offered subscription options and the CLI commands will not execute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the available mailing list(s) in the \nlists\n array. Here is an example:\n\n\nlists\n =\n [\n\n\n    \nmembers\n =\n [\n\n\n        \nname\n    =\n \nMembers\n Mailing List\n,\n\n\n        \ndesc\n    =\n \nA longer description as presented in IXP Manager.\n,\n\n\n        \nemail\n   =\n \nmembers@example.com\n,\n\n\n        \narchive\n =\n \nhttps://www.example.com/mailman/private/members/\n,\n\n\n        \nsyncpws\n =\n false,\n\n\n    ],\n\n\n    \ntech\n =\n [\n\n\n        \nname\n    =\n \nTech/Operations Mailing List\n,\n\n\n        \ndesc\n    =\n \nA longer description as presented in IXP Manager.\n,\n\n\n        \nemail\n   =\n \ntech@example.com\n,\n\n\n        \narchive\n =\n \nhttps://www.example.com/mailman/private/tech/\n\n\n        \nsyncpws\n =\n false,\n\n\n    ],\n\n\n],\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the \nmembers\n and \ntech\n array keys above are the list handles that will be used by the API interfaces later. It is also important that they match the Mailman list key.\n\n\nHistorically, mailing list passwords were also sync'd from the IXP Manager user database \nunless\n \nsyncpws\n is both defined and false for the given list. As we are now recommending \nbcrypt\n as the standard password hashing mechanism, we no longer recommend this and suggest allowing Mailman to manage its own passwords.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaths to Mailman commands.

As such, these scripts are written so that email addresses in common between IXP Manager and Mailman can manage their subscriptions in IXP Manager but those other subscribers will be unaffected.\n\n\nUsers in IXP Manager will either be marked as being subscribed to a list, not subscribed to a list or neither (i.e. a new user). Subscriptions are managed by user preferences (in the database) of the format:\n\n\nmailinglist.listname1.subscribed = 0/1\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are four steps to performing the synchronisation \nfor each list\n which are done by either using the IXP Manager CLI script \n$IXPROOT/bin/ixptool.php\n or the older \nAPI V1\n interface.\n\n\nCLI Interface Overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe execution of the \nmailing-list-cli.list-init\n script which is really for new IXP Manager users (or initial set up of the mailing list feature). This script is piped the full subscribers list from Mailman (via \nlist_members\n). This function will iterate through all users and, if they have no preference set for subscription to this list, will either add a \"not subscribed\" preference if their email address is not in the provided list of subscribers or a \"subscribed\" preference if it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe execution of the \nmailing-list-cli.get-subscribed\n action which lists all users who are subscribed to the given mailing list based on their user preferences. This is piped to the \nadd_members\n Mailman script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe execution of the \nmailing-list-cli.get-unsubscribed\n action which lists all users who are unsubscribed to the given mailing list based on their user preferences. This is piped to the \nremove_members\n Mailman script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe execution of the \nmailing-list-cli.password-sync\n action which sets the mailing list password for  all users who are unsubscribed to the given mailing list based on their IXP Manager user password. This action \nexec()\n's' the change password command directly. \nSee Password Synchronisation below.\n Unlike the above three operations, the password sync executes a command directly (via PHP \nexec()\n). If you just want to print the commands to stdout, add the parameters \n-v -p noexec=1\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI V1 Interface Overview\n\n\nThe CLI version of mailing list management was presented above. If you wish to use the API version, proceed as follows where:\n\n\n\n\n$MyKey\n is one of your SUPERUSER API keys;\n\n\nhttps://www.example.com/ixp/\n is your IXP Manager web interface;\n\n\nmembers\n is an example mailing list handle as defined above in \n$IXPROOT/config/mailinglists.php\n.\n\n\n\n\nUse the initialisation function for new IXP Manager users (or initial set up of the mailing list feature) which updates IXP Manager with all currently subscribed mailing list members:\n\n\n/path/to/mailman/bin/list_members members \n/tmp/ml-listname1.txt\ncurl -f --data-urlencode addresses@/tmp/ml-listname1.txt \n\\\n\n    \nhttps://www.example.com/ixp/apiv1/mailing-list/init/key/\n$MyKey\n/list/members\n\nrm /tmp/ml-listname1.txt\n\n\n\n\n\nPipe all subscribed users to the \nadd_members\n Mailman script:\n\n\ncurl -f \nhttps://www.example.com/ixp/apiv1/mailing-list/get-subscribed/key/\n$MyKey\n/list/members\n \n|\n \n\\\n\n    /path/to/mailman/bin/add_members -r - -w n -a n members \n/dev/null\n\n\n\n\n\nPipe all users who are unsubscribed to the \nremove_members\n Mailman script:\n\n\ncurl -f \nhttps://www.example.com/ixp/apiv1/mailing-list/get-unsubscribed/key/\n$MyKey\n/list/members\n \n|\n \n\\\n\n    /path/to/mailman/bin/remove_members -f - -n -N members \n/dev/null\n\n\n\n\n\nSync the passwords from IXP Manager to Mailman with something like:\n\n\ncurl -f \nhttps://www.example.com/ixp/apiv1/mailing-list/password-sync/key/MyKey/list/listname1\n \n|\n \n\\\n\n    egrep \n^/path/to/mailman/bin/withlist -q -l -r changepw \n.+\n \n.+\n \n.+\n$\n \n|\n /bin/sh \n/dev/null\n\n\n\n\n\n(Feel free to make the above regexp more secure and update this document).\n        \n\n\nHow to Implement\n\n\nYou can implement mailing list management by configuring IXP Manager as above.\n\n\nIXP Manager will then generate shell scripts to manage all of the above.\n\n\nExecute the following command for the CLI version:\n\n\nbin/ixptool.php -a mailing-list-cli.sync-script \nbin/mailing-list-sync.sh\n\n\n\n\n\nOr the following for the API V1 version \n(and make sure to update the assignments at the top of the script)\n:\n\n\nbin/ixptool.php -a mailing-list-cli.sync-script --p1\n=\napiv1 \nbin/mailing-list-sync-apiv1.sh\n\n\n\n\n\nThis generates a script called \nmailing-list-sync[-apiv1].sh\n which performs each of the above four steps for each configured mailing list. If your mailing list configuration does not change, you will not need to rerun this.\n\n\nYou should now put this script into crontab on the appropriate server (same server for CLI!) and run as often as you feel is necessary. The current \nsuccess\n message for a user updating their subscriptions says \nwithin 12 hours\n so we'd recommend at least running twice a day.\n\n\nPassword Synchronisation\n\n\nWe now recommend against this \nfor the reasons explained here\n. We have not investigated if Mailman can support Bcrypt as of yet.\n\n\nBy default, passwords from IXP Manager users with mailing list subscriptions will be sync'd to Mailman.\n\n\nThis is done via the Mailman \nwithlist\n script and it requires a \nchangepw.py\n script to be in the same directory as \nwithlist\n and this script is not supplied by default (although it is documented). Create the following \nchangepw.py\n in the same directory as \nwithlist\n:\n\n\nfrom\n \nMailman.Errors\n \nimport\n \nNotAMemberError\n\n\n\ndef\n \nchangepw\n(\nmlist\n,\n \naddr\n,\n \nnewpasswd\n):\n\n    \ntry\n:\n\n        \nmlist\n.\nsetMemberPassword\n(\naddr\n,\n \nnewpasswd\n)\n\n        \nmlist\n.\nSave\n()\n\n    \nexcept\n \nNotAMemberError\n:\n\n        \nprint\n \nNo address matched:\n,\n \naddr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTodo\n\n\n\n\nbetter handling of multiple users with the same email address and documentation of same\n\n\nuser changes email address",

We have approached the issue a number of times in IXP Manger but abandoned the attempt every time. Typically our original solutions were over-engineered where all we really needed was something which could replace a spreadsheet per panel.\n\n\nWe believe we have now developed a feature complete and useful means of managing patch panels and associated cross connects.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nAdd / edit patch panels  (which includes cable and connector types).\n\n\nList associated patch panel ports which includes:\n\n\ntheir state (such as available / prewired, awaiting cross connect, connected, awaiting cease, reserved, broken).\n\n\nassociated customer and/or switchport.\n\n\nco-location provider's circuit reference.\n\n\ninternal ticket references.\n\n\nTransition ports from available / prewired to awaiting x-connect to connected to awaiting cease to ceased and then available again.\n\n\nCustomer view of their cross connects.\n\n\nPublic (visible to customers) and private notes per cross connect.\n\n\nAttach public and private files to cross connects (such as test results, completion documents, order forms, etc).\n\n\nMaintain complete history of a patch panel port.\n\n\nGenerate and email LoAs (as PDF) with a URL verification function for co-location providers.\n\n\nGenerate emails for connection and cease requests as well as an email providing full customer view of a cross connect.\n\n\nTypically fibre ports are \nduplex\n ports but there is a growing use of BiDi optics meaning simplex ports. Our implementation treats all ports as simplex but you can mark it as duplex and set its partner port.\n\n\n\n\nDuplex Fibre Ports\n\n\nWe suggest adding fibre ports as two ports per duplex port. I.e. if your patch panel has 12 duplex ports, enter this as 24 ports. When allocating ports later, you can set it as a duplex port and select its \npartner / slave port\n. This will future proof your patch panels for the growing use of bidi optics and other simplex based xWDM fibre solutions.\n\n\nFrom our experience, duplex fibre ports are often identified as their individual strands. For example, \nduplex port 5\n would be referenced as \nF9/F10\n.\n\n\nYour mileage may vary on this but we need to allow this flexibility to cover both use-cases. You always have options however:\n\n\n\n\nyou can change the presentation of how these ports are referenced externally by \nskinning\n the templates.\n\n\nyou have the option to edit emails before they are sent to also present this as you wish.\n\n\nyou can chose to treat duplex ports as single ports rather than doubling them up.\n\n\nwhen you have duplex ports on a patch panel, IXP Manager will provide a duplex view by default with a CSS-based toggle to reveal the typical partner ports.\n\n\nif you think IXP Manager can make this easier, please talk to us. \nBut we cannot cover every use case programatically. We've opted to allow flexibility rather than dictate a particular format.\n\n\n\n\nAdding a Patch Panel\n\n\nThe following image shows a typical \nadd a new patch panel\n form (as of v4.3). You'll note that clicking \nHelp\n provides detailed context aware help messages.\n\n\n\n\nMost of this is self-explanatory but:\n\n\n\n\nBy default, we set the \nColocation Reference\n to the \nPatch Panel Name\n. We are not sure it's a good idea for IXPs to create a second name different to the co-location provider's but this option is available to you. \nSeriously, think about what you are doing here - more references means more confusion!\n The cabinet and cable type is displayed in the list of patch panels so even with obscure data centre references, it should be easy to find what you need.\n\n\nLocation Notes\n: Data centre / co-location providers do a lot of weird, wonderful and strange things! They provide multiple references for a single patch panel (IXP cabinet, MMR, etc.), they get taken over and re-reference everything or even provide no discernable reference. The field is a freetext field that will be included (and parsed as Markdown) in all emails generated by IXP Manager to help you help them identify a patch panel!\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to that, we will also use a cabinets \nU's are counted from top/bottom\n, and a patch panel's \nU position\n and \nmounted at front/rear\n to also create a location description.\n\n When setting the \nNumber of Ports\n, ensure you count duplex fibre ports as \ntwo ports\n. So 12 duplex fibre ports would be entered as 24. When editing a patch panel, this input field represents the number of additional ports you want to add to a patch panel and thus defaults to 0 in that situation.\n\n \nPort Name Prefix\n: This is an optional field intended for use on fibre patch panels. As an example, you may wish to prefix individual fibre strands in a duplex port with F which would mean the name of a duplex port would be displayed as F1/F2.\n* \nChargeable\n: Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. Setting this only sets the default option when allocating ports to members later. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other.\n\n\nFiltering Patch Panel Ports\n\n\nQuite often, all you are looking for is a free in a particular location (data centre) or cabinet of a particular cable type (UTP / SMF / etc.).\n\n\nIXP Manager makes this easy from the \nPatch Panels\n page via the top right button labeled \nFilter Options\n. When clicked, this yields an advanced search as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCabinets auto-fills when you chose (or change) a location.\n\n\nPatch Panel Port States\n\n\nA patch panel port can have the following states:\n\n\n\n\nAvailable\n: The port is free and available for use.\n\n\nPrewired\n: This is equivalent to available but it means the port is prewired to a given switchport (you set the port when setting the prewired status). This is useful for IXPs that prewire a bunch of ports to avoid remote hands costs / data centre visits.\n\n\nAwaiting Xconnect\n: Port has been assigned to a member and we are awaiting the co-location provider to install the cross connect. In this state, context aware actions such as emailing connection requests, LoA generation and \nSet Connected\n are all available.\n\n\nConnected\n: Connected and in use.\n\n\nAwaiting Cease\n: This connection is no longer required and we are awaiting the end user / co-location provider to cease the connection.\n\n\nCeased\n: You will never see a ceased state. When a cross connect is marked as ceased, it's current state is archived (for history, include files) and the port is reset to \nAvailable\n. We do not revert to \nPrewired\n but an information message is shown to the user to hint this.\n\n\nReserved\n: Useful to mark particular ports as \noff limits\n for whatever reason.\n\n\nBroken\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\nFree / Available Ports\n\n\nIXP Manager will colour ports in the \nAvailable\n, \nPrewired\n and \nAwaiting Cease\n states are green allowing an easy visual indication of available ports.\n\n\nPatch Panel Port Lifecycle\n\n\nPatch panel ports start as either \navailable\n or \nprewired\n. The context menu in these states is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnset Prewired\n is available as this port has a \nPrewired\n status. Clicking this reverts it to plain \nAvailable\n and disassociates it from the prewired port.\n\n\nEdit Note...\n is always available and provides a pop up to edit public and private notes associated with the port (current lifecycle - ceased ports have their notes at that time archived and cleared).\n\n\n\n\nThe main lifecycle option here is \nAllocate\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n: A one line short description to be shown in the list of patch panel ports. Just enough to help explain the ports purpose. Detailed information should be placed in the notes section. Can also be used to explain a reserved / broken / other port. Note that this is parsed as Markdown. \nNB:\n A description is discouraged for customer ports connected to a switch. The customer name and switch port are the description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColocation Circuit Reference\n: this is the reference provided by the colocation provider to uniquely reference this cross connect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTicket Reference(s)\n: This is a free text field to be used by IXPs as they wish. The intended use is to enter helpdesk ticket references that relate to this cross connect order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuplex connection?\n: Clicking this allows you to select the slave port for duplex connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch / Switch Port\n / \nCustomer\n: You have a number of options when allocating a port:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the port is pre-wired then the switch / switch port will be set here.\n\n\n\n\nIf you chose a switch port which has been allocated to a customer, then this patch panel port will also be allocated to that customer. The backend logic will detect if this is the case and update the customer field.\n\n\nConversely, if you chose a customer first, the switch / switch port dropdowns will be populated with only that customer's assigned ports.\n\n\nSometimes you will get cross connects that are not intended to be connected to peering switches (e.g. connections to co-located customer equipment, IXP metro connections, etc.). In these cases, just select the customer (and if it's the IXP itself, select the IXP customer) and leave switch / switch port unselected.\n\n\n\n\nIf you need to reset these fields, just click either of the Reset button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatch Panel Port Status\n: when allocating a port, this will allow you to set the state to \nAwaiting Xconnect\n or \nConnected\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Interface Status\n: this is not depicted above. If the selected switch port has already been assigned to a customer by way of a physical interface, you will have the option to update this here also.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic\n and \nPrivate Notes\n: Public notes are available to the customer. Both fields are interpreted as Markdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChargeable\n: Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other. How individual IXPs use this is up to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Use\n: Marks the port as used by the IXP itself. E.g. metro connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwned By\n: Useful indication for billing and cease requests. Should represent the contractural owner of the cross connect. One of: Customer, IXP, Service Provider, Data Centre, Other. \nService Provider\n might be a metro provider where they ordered the cross connect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce a port is allocated, it enters the \nAwaiting XConnect\n / \nConnected\n state and there are additional context menu options available:\n\n\n\n\nThe three lifecycle actions are:\n\n\n\n\nSet Connected\n: updates the status (and allows you to add public/private notes). You next action after this should be \nEmail - Connect\n.\n\n\nSet Awaiting Cease\n: mark the port and pending disconnection. Your next action after this should be \nEmail - Cease\n.\n\n\nSet Ceased\n: this is a \ntransitive state\n in that it doesn't \nstick\n. When you mark a patch panel as ceased, the existing details (including files and notes) are archived as part of the port's history and then port is then cleared and made available again.\n\n\n\n\nFile Attachments\n\n\nOver the lifetime of a cross connect - and particularly when it is being ordered, there may be files exchanges between you and your customers or the colocation provider. These can be added to the patch panel port via the \nAttach File...\n option.\n\n\nThe dialog will dynamically determine the maximum file upload size based on your PHP settings. To alter this, change the following in your server's appropriate \nphp.ini\n:\n\n\n; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.\nupload_max_filesize = 40M\n\n; Must be greater than or equal to upload_max_filesize\npost_max_size = 40M\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease search the internet for further help as this is outside the scope of IXP Manager documentation.\n\n\nThe following features apply to file attachments:\n\n\n\n\nthey are archived along with the port history when a cross connect is ceased.\n\n\nthey are stored under \n$IXPROOT/storage/files/ppp\n.\n\n\ntwo files of the same name cannot be uploaded for a single patch panel port.\n\n\nthey can be marked as public or private:\n\n\npublic files are accessible to the customer through their own dashboard.\n\n\npublic files are attached to the \nEmail - Information\n email.\n\n\n\n\nLoA Generation\n\n\nMany co-location providers will not accept a cross connect order without a LoA \n(Letter of Agency/Authority)\n from the party to whom the cross connect is to be delivered (typically the IXP).\n\n\nIXP Manager will generate a PDF LoA to download or include in the emails it generates for you. Here is an example:\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to \nskin\n this yourself to change the legalese, address and contact details and potentially add a logo. See the version INEX uses \nhere\n (which includes and embedded PNG logo).\n\n\nNote that \nDompdf\n is used to turn the HTML template into a PDF and it has some restrictions.\n\n\nYou have two options for generating LoAs (without having IXP Manager email them):\n\n\n\n\nDownload PDF\n: downloads the PDF via your browser.\n\n\nView PDF\n: displays the PDF LoA in your browser (where browser supports it).\n\n\n\n\nLoA Verification\n\n\nThe stock LoA template (and INEX's version) includes a link that allows co-location browsers to click on to verify its veracity.\n\n\nOn successful verification, the end user sees:\n\n\n\n\nEmail Generation\n\n\nIXP Manager allows you to send four emails related to patch panels / cross connects (port status dependent). These are listed below. The Email editor looks as follows:\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\n\n\n\nthe option to attach a PDF LoA is a checkbox.\n\n\nthe email is written in Markdown with a preview available. The email is sent as both HTML (from the Markdown) and the plaintext version.\n\n\n\n\nThe four email templates available are:\n\n\n\n\nEmail - Connect\n: Email the customer a request to order a cross connect to the given demarcation points. A LoA is attached as a PDF by default unless you uncheck the box in the email editor.\n\n\nEmail - Cease\n: Email the customer a request to cease a cross connect.\n\n\nEmail - Information\n: Email the customer all details on file about a cross connect. We often get requests for this at INEX and this simplifies the process. The generated email includes:\n\n\nthe standard details regarding port and co-location reference;\n\n\npublic notes;\n\n\npublic files as attachments.\n\n\nEmail - LoA\n: Email a LoA to the customer as attached as a PDF. This is similar to \nEmail - Connect\n but it is more reflective of a typical response to a second request for a LoA.\n\n\n\n\nAll email templates can be \nskinned\n for your own needs. See INEX's example skins \nhere\n.\n\n\nViewing Patch Panel Details and Archives\n\n\nEach patch panel port row has the following button:\n\n\n\n\nThe number in the badge indicates how many historical records are available.\n\n\nClicking on the button yields the following view screen:\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment History\n\n\nThe Patch Panels functionality was developed during Q1 2017 and added in March 2017.

From our experience, duplex fibre ports are often identified as their individual strands. For example,  duplex port 5  would be referenced as  F9/F10 .  Your mileage may vary on this but we need to allow this flexibility to cover both use-cases. You always have options however:   you can change the presentation of how these ports are referenced externally by  skinning  the templates.  you have the option to edit emails before they are sent to also present this as you wish.  you can chose to treat duplex ports as single ports rather than doubling them up.  when you have duplex ports on a patch panel, IXP Manager will provide a duplex view by default with a CSS-based toggle to reveal the typical partner ports.  if you think IXP Manager can make this easier, please talk to us.

For example, INEX runs two parallel route collectors: one quarantine and one production. When customers have issues or are being provisioned, they are placed in the quarantine LAN and we can examine BGP announcements safely on the non-production quarantine devices. When a router is marked as quarantine, it is only visible in looking glass dropdowns to customers who also have a port in quarantine (physical interface status).\n\n\nbgp_lc\n - a flag to indicate if the router supports \nRFC8092\n / \nlarge BGP communities\n.\n\n\ntemplate\n - the template to use to generate the configuration. See stock examples \nhere\n (and note that \nskinning\n is supported).\n\n\n\n\nTypically your \nrouters.php\n file would hold multiple such entries. It is our intention to move this into the UI and database.\n\n\nGeneration Overview\n\n\nThe simplest configuration to generate is the route collector configuration. A route collector is an IXP router which serves only to \naccept all routes and export no routes\n. It is used for problem diagnosis, to aid customer monitoring and for looking glasses (see \nINEX's here\n.\n\n\nThe \nstandard configuration\n simply pulls in a fairly standard header (sets up router ID, listening address and - for the collector at least - some unused filters) and creates a session for all customer routers on the given VLAN (see \nvlan_id\n above).\n\n\nIn the above example, the route handle is the array's associative key (\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n) and - for the given router handle - the configuration can be generated via:\n\n\n# The key is generated in IXP Manager via the top right menu: *My Account -\n API Keys*\nKEY=\nyour-admin-ixp-manager-api-key\n\n# The base URL of your IXP Manager install plus: \napi/v4/router/gen_config\n\nURL=\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/gen_config\n\n# The handle is the PHP associative key from `config/routers.php` as described above\nHANDLE=\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n\n# Then the complete URL is formed as:\ncurl --fail -s -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: ${KEY}\n ${URL}/${HANDLE} \n${HANDLE}.conf\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigurations for the route server and AS112 templates can be configured just as easily. The stock templates for both are secure and well tested and can be used by setting the \ntemplate\n element of the router configuration above to the following:\n\n\n\n\nAS112: \n'api/v4/router/as112/bird/standard'\n\n\nRoute Server: \n'api/v4/router/server/bird/standard'\n\n\n\n\nWe also provide sample scripts for automating the re-configuration of these services by cron. See the \n-v4\n scripts \nin this directory\n. These are quite robust and have been in production for ~3 years at INEX (as of Jan 2017).\n\n\nRoute Servers\n\n\nNormally on a peering exchange, all connected parties will establish bilateral peering relationships with each other customer connected to the exchange. As the number of connected parties increases, it becomes increasingly more difficult to manage peering relationships with customers of the exchange.\n\n\nHowever, by using a route servers for peering relationships, the number of BGP sessions per router stays at two: one for each route server (assuming a resilient set up). Clearly this is a more sustainable way of maintaining IXP peering relationships with a large number of participants.\n\n\nYou will have learnt above how to automatically generate route server configurations. This section goes into a bit more specific detail on INEX's route server configuration (shipped with IXP Manager) and why it's safe to use.\n\n\nThe features of the route server configurations that we generate include:\n\n\n\n\nfull prefix filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required);\n\n\nfull origin ASN filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required);\n\n\nin all cases, prefix filtering for IPv4 and v6 based on the IANA special purpose registries (also known as bogon lists);\n\n\nensuring next hop is the neighbor address to ensure no next hop hijacking;\n\n\nmax prefix limits;\n\n\nmultiple VLAN interfaces for a single member supported;\n\n\nlarge BGP communities supported;\n\n\na decade of production use and experience.\n\n\n\n\nThere are \nsome old notes on route server testing here\n which may also be useful.\n\n\nIRRDB Prefixes and ASN Filtering\n\n\nIXP Manager can maintain a list of member route:/route6: prefixes and origin ASNs as registered in IRRDBs in its database and then use these to, for example, generate strict inbound filters on route servers.\n\n\nPrerequisite:\n you need to have set up some IRRDB sources (e.g. RIPE's whois service) under the \nIXP Admin Actions / IRRDB Configuration\n on the left hand side menu. There is a database seeder to install some to start you off via the following (but thius is typically done during installation):\n\n\n./artisan db:seed --class=IRRDBs\n\n\n\n\n\nBGPQ3 is a very easy and fast way of querying IRRDBs. You first need to install this on your system. Then configure the path to it in \nconfig/ixp_tools.php\n. If you have not used this file before, you'll need to create your own local copy as follows:\n\n\ncp config/config/ixp_tools.php.dist config/config/ixp_tools.php\n\n\n\n\n\nThen set the full call path for \nbgpq3\n in this file:\n\n\n?php\n\n\n  \nirrdb\n \n=\n \n[\n\n        \nbgpq\n \n=\n \n[\n\n            \npath\n \n=\n \n/path/to/bgpq3\n,\n\n        \n],\n\n    \n],\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo populate (and update) your local IRRDB, run the following commands (changing the path as appropriate):\n\n\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-prefix-db\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-asn-db\n\n\n\n\n\nThese should be added to cron to run ~once per day (using the --quiet flag).\n\n\nThere are four levels of verbosity:\n\n\n\n\n-quiet\n: no output unless there's an error / issue.\n\n\nno option: simple stats on each customer's update results.\n\n\n-vv\n: include per customer and overall timings (database, processing and network).\n\n\n-vvv\n (debug): show prefixes/ASNs added remove also.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also specify a specific customer to update (rather than all) with an additional free form parameter. The database is searched for a matching customer in the order: customer ASN; customer ID (database primary key); and customer shortname. E.g.:\n\n\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-prefix-db 64511\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IRRDB update commands will:\n\n\n\n\niterate over all route server client customers for IPv4 and IPv6 (unless a specific customer is specified);\n\n\nuse the appropriate AS macro or ASN;\n\n\nquery the RADB against the appropriate source set for that customer;\n\n\ncompare prefixes(/ASNs) in the database already (if any) against RADB and insert / delete as appropriate;\n\n\nvalidate the prefix for proper CIDR notation before database inserts;\n\n\nupdate the last_seen time for all prefixes(/ASNs) for that customer;\n\n\n\n\nWe use transactions to update the database so, even in the middle of a refresh, a full set of prefixes for all customers will still be available.\n\n\nNote that our current implementation only queries RADB as BGPQ3 does not support the RIPE whois protocol.\n Our version will however set the RADB source database according to the member's stated IRRDB database as set on the customer add / edit page - so, for customer's registered with the RIPE IRRDB, the RIPE database of RADB is queried.",

See stock examples \nhere\n (and note that \nskinning\n is supported).\n\n\n\n\nTypically your \nrouters.php\n file would hold multiple such entries. It is our intention to move this into the UI and database.\n\n\nGeneration Overview\n\n\nThe simplest configuration to generate is the route collector configuration. A route collector is an IXP router which serves only to \naccept all routes and export no routes\n. It is used for problem diagnosis, to aid customer monitoring and for looking glasses (see \nINEX's here\n.\n\n\nThe \nstandard configuration\n simply pulls in a fairly standard header (sets up router ID, listening address and - for the collector at least - some unused filters) and creates a session for all customer routers on the given VLAN (see \nvlan_id\n above).\n\n\nIn the above example, the route handle is the array's associative key (\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n) and - for the given router handle - the configuration can be generated via:\n\n\n# The key is generated in IXP Manager via the top right menu: *My Account -\n API Keys*\nKEY=\nyour-admin-ixp-manager-api-key\n\n# The base URL of your IXP Manager install plus: \napi/v4/router/gen_config\n\nURL=\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/gen_config\n\n# The handle is the PHP associative key from `config/routers.php` as described above\nHANDLE=\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n\n# Then the complete URL is formed as:\ncurl --fail -s -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: ${KEY}\n ${URL}/${HANDLE} \n${HANDLE}.conf\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigurations for the route server and AS112 templates can be configured just as easily. The stock templates for both are secure and well tested and can be used by setting the \ntemplate\n element of the router configuration above to the following:\n\n\n\n\nAS112: \n'api/v4/router/as112/bird/standard'\n\n\nRoute Server: \n'api/v4/router/server/bird/standard'\n\n\n\n\nWe also provide sample scripts for automating the re-configuration of these services by cron. See the \n-v4\n scripts \nin this directory\n. These are quite robust and have been in production for ~3 years at INEX (as of Jan 2017).\n\n\nRoute Servers\n\n\nNormally on a peering exchange, all connected parties will establish bilateral peering relationships with each other customer connected to the exchange. As the number of connected parties increases, it becomes increasingly more difficult to manage peering relationships with customers of the exchange.\n\n\nHowever, by using a route servers for peering relationships, the number of BGP sessions per router stays at two: one for each route server (assuming a resilient set up). Clearly this is a more sustainable way of maintaining IXP peering relationships with a large number of participants.\n\n\nYou will have learnt above how to automatically generate route server configurations. This section goes into a bit more specific detail on INEX's route server configuration (shipped with IXP Manager) and why it's safe to use.\n\n\nThe features of the route server configurations that we generate include:\n\n\n\n\nfull prefix filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required);\n\n\nfull origin ASN filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required);\n\n\nin all cases, prefix filtering for IPv4 and v6 based on the IANA special purpose registries (also known as bogon lists);\n\n\nensuring next hop is the neighbor address to ensure no next hop hijacking;\n\n\nmax prefix limits;\n\n\nmultiple VLAN interfaces for a single member supported;\n\n\nlarge BGP communities supported;\n\n\na decade of production use and experience.\n\n\n\n\nThere are \nsome old notes on route server testing here\n which may also be useful.\n\n\nIRRDB Prefixes and ASN Filtering\n\n\nIXP Manager can maintain a list of member route:/route6: prefixes and origin ASNs as registered in IRRDBs in its database and then use these to, for example, generate strict inbound filters on route servers.\n\n\nPrerequisite:\n you need to have set up some IRRDB sources (e.g. RIPE's whois service) under the \nIXP Admin Actions / IRRDB Configuration\n on the left hand side menu.

INEX bundles its own skinned templates in \nresources/skins/inex\n as an example.\n\n\nOnce a skin is enabled from \n.env\n, then any templates found in the skin directory \n(using the same directory structure as found under \nresouces/views\n)\n will take precedence over the default template file. This means you do not need to recreate / copy all the default files - just replace the ones you want.\n\n\nIn previous versions of \nIXP Manager\n, we used Smarty as the templating engine. This meant that if someone wanted to help improve \nIXP Manager\n then they would need to become familiar with PHP \nand\n Smarty. In v4 we dropped Smarty and, rather than using another compiled templating engine, we have decided to go with native PHP templates.\n\n\nFor this, we are using \nFoil\n - \nFoil brings all the flexibility and power of modern template engines to native PHP templates. Write simple, clean and concise templates with nothing more than PHP.\n Also, simulaneously supported are Lavael's own \nBlade templates\n which we sometimes use for simple pages.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThe \ngraphing\n MRTG configuration generator allows for custom configuration content at the top and bottom of the file. In order to have your custom configuration enabled, you need to skin two files.\n\n\nHere's an example:\n\n\n# position ourselves in the IXP Manager root directory\ncd /path/to/ixp4\n\n# make the skin directory\nmkdir resources/skins/example\n\n# create the full path required for the MRTG configuration files:\nmkdir -p resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg\n\n# copy over the customisation files:\ncp views/services/grapher/mrtg/custom-header.foil.php resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg\ncp views/services/grapher/mrtg/custom-footer.foil.php resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg\n\n# edit the above files as required\nvi resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg/custom-header.plates.php\nvi resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg/custom-footer.plates.php\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, finally, edit \n.env\n and set the skin to use:\n\n\nVIEW_SKINS=\nexample\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can of course skin any file including the non-custom MRTG files as suits your needs.\n\n\nCustom Variables / Configuration Options\n\n\nWhen you are skinning your own templates, you may find you need to create custom configuration options for values you do not want to store directly in your own templates. For this, we have a configuration file which is excluded from Git. Initiate it via::\n\n\ncp config/custom.php.dist config/custom.php\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is \nLaravel's standard configuration file format\n (which is an associative PHP array). You can also use Laravel's dotenv variables here too.\n\n\nAs an example, if you were to create a configuration option:\n\n\n?php\n\n\nexample\n \n=\n \n[\n\n    \nkey\n \n=\n \nmy own config value\n,\n\n\n],\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthen in code this would be accessible as:\n\n\n?php\n\n\nconfig\n(\n \ncustom.example.key\n,\n \ndefault value if not set|null\n \n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the second parameter is a default option if the requested configuration setting has not been defined (which defaults to \nnull\n). In templates, this can be accessed the same way or rendered in the template with::\n\n\n?\n=\n \nconfig\n(\n \ncustom.example.key\n,\n \ndefault\n \n)\n \n?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkinning Old Templates\n\n\nThis is still important as \nIXP Manager\n v4 still uses most of the previous templates.\n\n\nTo skin files found under \napplication/[modules/xxx/]views\n, proceed as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset a skin name in \n.env\n:\n   \nVIEW_SMARTY_SKIN=\nmyskin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncreate a directory with a matching name: \napplication/views/_skins/myskin\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the above \n.env\n option is set, then any pages in its skin directory (using the same directory structure as \napplication/views\n will take precedence over the default template files.
