IXP Manager is open-source and free software. Any individual or organisation who installs IXP Manager and/or makes it available for use must ensure that they are complying with all appropriate data protection legislation in their jurisdiction as the data controller.

This page details what the developers consider appropriate information to the best of their knowledge for helping such organisations with such compliance. Note also that the information herein is based on IXP Manager's default configuration. 


## Cookies


Cookies are small text files that websites place on your device as you are browsing. They are processed and stored by your web browser. Cookies can generally be easily viewed and deleted via your browser's functionality. Each cookie is unique to your web browser and will usually contain information such as the cookie name, a unique identifier, and the website's host name or domain name.

**IXP Manager** uses a PHP web application framework called Laravel and it generates two encrypted cookies which are required to use the application: 

| Cookie Name | Purpose and Description | Classification | Lifetime |
|-------|--------|------|------|
| `laravel_session` | Session management - since HTTP driven applications are stateless, sessions provide a way to store information about the user across multiple requests. These cookies are encrypted by the server and the client browser only receives and stores the encrypted version. | Strictly Necessary | 120 minutes |
| `XSRF-TOKEN` | Cross-site request forgeries are a type of malicious exploit whereby unauthorized commands are performed on behalf of an authenticated user. Laravel stores the current CSRF token in an encrypted `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie that is included with each response generated by the framework.  | Strictly Necessary | 120 minutes |

A third cookie is generated if a user **optionally** invokes the *Remember Me* functionality during login / authentication:

| Cookie Name | Purpose and Description | Classification | Lifetime |
|-------|--------|------|------|
| `remember_web_xxx` | Session management cookie to facilitate longer sessions and multiple session functionality. These cookies are encrypted by the server and only the encrypted version exists on the client side browser. These only contain a session ID. The server records the user's IP address and a browser identifier (e.g. *Macintosh 10 / Firefox 109.0*) so that users can identify and optionally delete long-lived sessions in the user interface. | Strictly Necessary | 30 days |

IXP Manager does not generate any other cookies.
