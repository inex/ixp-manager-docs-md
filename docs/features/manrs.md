# MANRS

[MANRS](https://www.manrs.org/) - *Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security* - is a global initiative, supported by the Internet Society, that provides crucial fixes to reduce the most common routing threats. ï»¿

IXP Manager rewards networks that have joined the MANRS program by highlighting this on the customer's public and internal pages - for example:

![MANRS Example](img/manrs-google.png)

This information is updated daily via the [task scheduler](cronjobs.md). If you want to run it manually, run this Artisan command:

```sh
$ php artisan ixp-manager:update-in-manrs -vv
MANRS membership updated - before/after/missing: 5/5/104
```

As you'll see from the output, it will show you the results. We will provide more tooling within IXP Manager to show this information in time.
