#Â Console Servers

An IXP would typically have out of band access (for emergencies, firmware upgrades, etc) to critical infrastructure devices by means of a console server.

**IXP Manager** has *Console Servers* and *Console Server Connections* menu options to allow IXP administrators add / edit / delete / list console server devices and, for any such device, record what console server port is connected to what device (as well as connection characteristics such as baud rate).

Each of these pages has a notes field which supports markdown to allow you to include sample connection sessions to devices. This is especially useful for rarely used console connections to awkward devices.
