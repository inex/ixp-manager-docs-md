# Welcome to IXP Manager

![IXP Manager Logo](img/ixp-manager.png)

**IXP Manager is the most trusted IXP platform worldwide.**


It is a full stack management system for Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) which includes an administration and customer portal; provides end to end provisioning; and both teaches and implements best practice. It allows IXPs to manage new customers, provision new connections / services and monitor traffic usage. It has a number of provisioning templates including its ability to generate secure proven route server configuration and provides a built in looking glass for these.

**[INEX](https://www.inex.ie/)** are pleased to release **[IXP Manager](http://www.ixpmanager.org/)** under an open source license (the GNU Public License V2) which we hope will benefit the wider IXP community, and especially new and small IXPs looking to expand.
