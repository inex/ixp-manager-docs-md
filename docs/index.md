*This documentation relates to IXP Manager >= v4. For v3, please see [the older documentation here](https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/wiki).*

**IXP Manager** is a full stack management system for Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) which includes an administration and customer portal; provides end to end provisioning; and both teaches and implements best practice.

**[INEX](https://www.inex.ie/)** are pleased to release **[IXP Manager](http://www.ixpmanager.org/)** under an open source license (the GNU Public License V2) which we hope will benefit the wider IXP community, and especially new and small IXPs looking to expand.

For a period, some older v3 documentation may still be useful. You can find that on the [wiki](https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/wiki).

## About IXP Manager

For detailed information, see: https://www.ixpmanager.org/

IXP Manager is primarily a web application with associated scripts and utilities which will allow IXPs to manage new customers, provision new connections / services and monitor traffic usage. It also has a self contained customer portal allowing IXP members to view their IXP traffic statistics and a unique tool called My Peering Manager enabling IXP members to request, manage and track peerings with other members.

[INEX](https://www.inex.ie/) is an Internet eXchange Point and Ireland's IP peering hub. It is a neutral, industry-owned Association, founded in 1996, that provides IP peering facilities for its members. INEX membership is open to all organisations that can benefit from peering their IP traffic.
