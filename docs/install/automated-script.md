The available installation script(s) can be found at: [https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/tree/master/tools/installers](https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/tree/master/tools/installers).

Even if you choose not to use these, the scripts under the above link show the accurate and complete installation process and should be used as a reference guide.

## Video Tutorial

We created a video tutorial demonstrating the installation process using the automated script for IXP Manager v6.0 (July 2021) on Ubuntu LTS 20.04.

The procedure is similar for v7.0 - **just be sure to use the [ubuntu-lts-2404-ixp-manager-v7.sh](https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/blob/release-v7/tools/installers/ubuntu-lts-2404-ixp-manager-v7.sh) script**.

You can find the [video here](https://youtu.be/-o2MqV56xJQ) in our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeW2fmMTBtE4fnlmg-2-evA). As always, [the full catalog of video tutorials is here](https://www.ixpmanager.org/support/tutorials).
