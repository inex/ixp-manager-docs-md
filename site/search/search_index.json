Long before test driven development or behaviour driven development was fashionable for PHP. However, as IXP Manager is taking over more and more critical configuration tasks, we continue to back fill some automated testing with continuous integration for critical elements. We use Travis-CI for continuous integration (CI) who provide free cloud based CI linked to GitHub for open source projects. Our current build status is: The CI system runs the full suite of tests every time a commit is pushed to GitHub. As such, any build failing states are usually transitory. Official IXP Manager releases are only made when all tests pass. We use two types of unit tests: PHP Unit for standard unit tests; Laravel Dusk for browser based tests. We won't be aggressively writing tests for the existing codebase but will add tests as appropriate as we continue development. What follows is some basic instructions on how to set up tests and an overview (or links) to some of the tests we have implemented. DISCLAIMER: This is not a tutorial on unit testing, phpunit, Laravel Dusk or anything else. If you have no experience with these tools, please read up on them elsewhere first. Setting Up PHPUnit Tests \uf0c1 Documentation by real example can be found via the .travis.yml file and the Travis data directory which contains scripts, database dumps and configurations. Testing assumes a known good sample database which contains a small mix of customers with different configuration options. The files generated from this database are tested against known good configuration files. You first need to create a database, add a database user, import this testing database and then configure a .env section for testing. In MySQL: CREATE DATABASE ixp_ci CHARACTER SET = 'utf8mb4' COLLATE = 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci'; GRANT ALL ON `ixp_ci`.* TO `ixp_ci`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED BY 'somepassword'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; Then import the sample database: bzcat data/travis-ci/travis_ci_test_db.sql.bz2 | mysql -h localhost -u ixp_ci -psomepassword ixp_ci Now, create your .env for testing, such as: DB_HOST=localhost DB_DATABASE=ixp_ci DB_USERNAME=ixp_ci DB_PASSWORD=somepassword Note that the phpunit.xml file in the root directory has some default settings matching the test database. You should not need to edit these. The .env file used by Travis CI can be seen here and - as it's used by Travis CI to run the tests - it should be a complete example of what is required. Setting Up Laravel Dusk \uf0c1 Please review the official documentation here . You need to ensure the development packages for IXP Manager are installed via: # move to the root directory of IXP Manager cd $IXPROOT composer install --dev You need to set the APP_URL environment variable in your .env file . This value should match the URL you use to access your application in a browser. Test Database Notes \uf0c1 The SUPERADMIN username / password is one-way hashed using bcrypt. If you want to log into the frontend of the test databse, these details are: travis / travisci . There are two test CUSTADMIN accounts which can be accessed using username / password: hecustadmin / travisci and imcustadmin / travisci . There are two test CUSTUSER accounts which can be accessed using username / password: hecustuser / travisci and imcustuser / travisci .

This page on Docker for IXP Manager development should be read in conjunction with the official IXP Manager Docker repository . While that repository is not for development purposes, the terminology and container descriptions apply here also. TL;DR Guide to Get Docker Running \uf0c1 If you want to get IXP Manager with Docker up and running quickly, follow these steps: Install Docker (see: https://www.docker.com/community-edition ) Clone IXP Manager to a directory: git clone https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager.git ixpmanager cd ixpmanager 3. Copy the stock Docker/IXP Manager configuration file and default database: cp .env.docker .env cp tools/docker/containers/mysql/docker.sql.dist tools/docker/containers/mysql/docker.sql Spin up the Docker containers docker-compose -p ixpm up Access IXP Manager on: http://localhost:8880/ Log in with one of the following username / passwords: Admin user: docker / docker01 Customer Admin: as112admin / as112admin Customer User: as112user / as112user General Overview \uf0c1 As the IXP Manager ecosystem grows, it becomes harder and harder to maintain ubiquitous development environments. Docker is ideally suited to solving these issues. The multi-container Docker environment for developing IXP Manager builds an IXP Manager system which includes: a custom MySQL database container (from mysql/5.7 ). the complete IXP Manager application built on the php/7.3-apache base. This has been preconfigured with some customers, routers, switches, etc. to match the following containers. two emulated switches via SNMP endpoints (using the excellent SNMP Agent Simulator via tandrup/snmpsim ); a mail trap with a web-based frontend to capture and analyse all emails sent by IXP Manager (thanks to schickling/mailcatcher ). a mrtg container to query the switches and build up mrtg log files / graphs (via cityhawk/mrtg ). a Bird-based route server pre-configured for 3 x IPv4 and 2 x IPv6 sessions. This also includes our Bird's Eye looking glass which has been integrated into rs1 container and configured into the IXP Manager container. five Bird-based route server clients complete with routes and a route server session. Useful Docker Commands \uf0c1 The following are a list of Docker commands that are useful in general but also specifically for the IXP Manager Docker environment. Note that in our examples, we set the Docker project name to ixpm and so that prefix is used in some of the below. We also assume that only one IXP Manager Docker environments is running and so we complate Docker container names with _1 . # show all running containers docker ps # show all containers - running and stopped docker ps -a # stop a container: docker stop container # start a container: docker start container # we create a 'ixpmanager' network. Sometimes you need to delete this when # stopping / starting the environment docker network rm ixpm_ixpmanager # you can copy files into a docker container via: docker cp test.sql ixmp_mysql_1:/tmp # where 'ixmp_mysql_1' is the container name. # reverse it to copy a file out: docker cp ixmp_mysql_1:/tmp/dump.sql . # I use two useful aliases for stopping and removing all containers: alias docker-stop-all='docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)' alias docker-rm-all='docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)' # You can also remove all unused (unattached) volumes: docker volume prune # WARNING: you might want to check what will be deleted with: docker volume ls -f dangling=true Development Use \uf0c1 As above, please note that in our examples, we set the Docker project name to ixpm and so that prefix is used in some of the below. We also assume that only one IXP Manager Docker environments is running and so we complete Docker container names with _1 . For most routine development use, you only need two containers usually: docker-compose -p ixpm up mysql www If you are sending emails as part of your development process, include the mail catcher: docker-compose -p ixpm up mysql www mailcatcher MySQL Database \uf0c1 When the mysql container builds, it pre-populates the database with the contents of the SQL file found at tools/docker/containers/mysql/docker.sql . This is not present by default and is ignored by Git (to ensure you do not accidentally commit a production database!). A default SQL database is bundled and should be placed in this location via: cp tools/docker/containers/mysql/docker.sql.dist tools/docker/containers/mysql/docker.sql You can put your own database here also. If you do, you will need to rebuilt the mysql contain: docker-compose build mysql You can access the MySQL database via: docker exec -it ixpm_mysql_1 mysql -i ixpmanager And you can get shell access to the container with: docker exec -it ixpm_mysql_1 bash You can also connect to the MySQL server from your local machine using tools such as the standard MySQL client, TablePlus or Sequel Pro with the following settings: mysql --protocol=TCP --port 33060 -u root Web Server \uf0c1 Note that the www container mounts the IXP Manager development directory under /srv/ixpmanager . This means all local code changes are immediately reflected on the Docker web server. The Dockerfile used to build the www container can be found at tools/docker/containers/www/Dockerfile . You can access the container with: docker exec -it ixpm_www_1 bash Mailcatcher \uf0c1 We include a mailcatcher container which catches all emails IXP Manager sends and displays them on a web frontend. Ensure this container is started by either: # start all containers: docker-compose -p ixpm up # start mailcatcher with (at least) mysql and www: docker-compose -p ixpm up mysql www mailcatcher The .env.docker config contains the following SMTP / mail settings which ensure emails get send to the mailcatcher: MAIL_HOST=172.30.201.11 MAIL_PORT=1025 You can then view emails sent on: http://localhost:1080/ Emulating Switches \uf0c1 ixpm_switch1_1 and ixpm_switch2_1 emulate switches by replaying SNMP dumps from real INEX switches (with some sanitisation). The OIDs for traffic have been replaced with a dynamic function to give varying values. From the www container, you can interact with these via: $ docker exec -it ixpm_www_1 bash # ping switch1 ... 64 bytes from switch1 (172.30.201.60): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.135 ms ... # ping switch2 ... 64 bytes from switch2 (172.30.201.61): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.150 ms ... # snmpwalk -On -v 2c -c switch1 switch1 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 = STRING: \"switch1\" # snmpwalk -On -v 2c -c switch2 switch2 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 = STRING: \"switch2\" You'll note from the above that the hostnames switch1 and switch2 work from the www container. Note also that the SNMP community is the hostname ( switch1 or switch2 as appropriate). The packaged database only contains switch1 . This allows you can add the second switch via http://localhost:8880/switch/add-by-snmp by setting the hostname and community to switch2 . If you want to add new customers for testing, add switch2 and then use interfaces Ethernet 2, 8, 13 and 6 and 7 as a lag as these have been preset to provide dynamic stats. Route Server and Clients \uf0c1 The containers include a working route server ( ixpm_rs1_1 ) with 3 IPv4 clients ( ixpm_cust-as112_1 , ixpm_cust-as42_1 , ixpm_cust-as1213_1 ) and and 2 IPv6 clients ( ixpm_cust-as1213-v6_1 , ixpm_cust-as25441-v6_1 ). IXP Manager also includes a working looking glass for this with Bird's Eye installed on the route server. You can access the Bird BGP clients on the five sample customers using the following examples: # access Bird command line interface: docker exec -it ixpm_cust-as112_1 birdc # run a specific Bird command docker exec -it ixpm_cust-as112_1 birdc show protocols The route server runs an IPv4 and an IPv6 daemon. These can be accessed via the looking glass at http://127.0.0.1:8881/ or on the command line via: # ipv4 daemon: docker exec -it ixpm_rs1_1 birdc -s /var/run/bird/bird-rs1-ipv4.ctl # ipv6 daemon: docker exec -it ixpm_rs1_1 birdc6 -s /var/run/bird/bird-rs1-ipv6.ctl In this container, Bird's Eye can be found at /srv/birdseye with the web server config under /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf . We include the IXP Manager scripts for updating the route server configuration and reconfiguring Bird: # get shell access to the container docker exec -it ixpm_rs1_1 bash # all scripts under the following directory cd /usr/local/sbin/ # reconfigure both daemons: ./api-reconfigure-all-v4.sh # reconfigure a specific daemon with verbosity: ./api-reconfigure-v4.sh -d -h rs1-ipv4 Mrtg / Grapher \uf0c1 For developing / testing Grapher with Mrtg, we include a container that runs Mrtg via cron from a pre-configured mrtg.conf file. NB: please ensure to update the GRAPHER_BACKENDS option in .env so it includes mrtg as follows: GRAPHER_BACKENDS=\"mrtg|dummy\" The configuration file matches the docker.sql configuration and can be seen in the IXP Manager source directory at tools/docker/mrtg/mrtg.cfg . You can access the Mrtg container via: docker exec -it ixpm_mrtg_1 sh We also install a script in the root directory of the container that will pull a new configuration from IXP Manager. Run it via: docker exec -it ixpm_mrtg_1 sh cd / ./update-mrtg-conf.sh # or without entering the container: docker exec -it ixpm_mrtg_1 /update-mrtg-conf.sh It will replace /etc/mrtg.conf for the next cron run. It also sets the configuration not to run as a daemon as cron is more useful for development. Managing Dockerfile \uf0c1 In this example, we look at the ixpmanager/www Docker image and update it from base php:7.0-apache to php:7.3-apache : cd cd tools/docker/containers/www # replace: # FROM php:7.0-apache # with: # FROM php:7.3-apache docker build . # or tag with: docker build -t ixpmanager/www:v5.0.0 docker push # if you're not logged in, use: docker login Do not forget to update your docker-compose.yml files to reference the new tag. Dev Tool Integrations \uf0c1 NB: these tools and integrations are not IXP Manager specific but rather the typical Docker / PHP development tool chain. Please use support forums for the relevant sections / tools rather than contacting the IXP Manager developers directly. PHP Storm and Xdebug \uf0c1 We are big fans of PhpStorm at IXP Manager DevHQ. One key feature is PhpStorm's integration with PHP Xdebug. We of course also need this to work with Docker. Some background information on Xdebug is provided below but you are expected to be familiar with the Xdebug documentation on remote debugging . The way interactive remote debugging works with Xdebug is as follows: Enable remote debugging on the PHP server ( php.ini settings on the www container). Your browser, with a suitable plugin, includes a Xdebug parameter to signal you want remote debugging started for this request (either a GET, POST or Cookie setting). PHP Xdebug connects to the configured remote debugger (PhpStorm in our case) allowing you to set break points, step through instructions, view variable contents at a point in time, etc. To get this working with Docker, we need to work through each of these steps. 1. Enable Remote Debugging in the Docker Container If you examine the www container Dockerfile in the IXP Manager source under tools/docker/containers/www/Dockerfile , you will see that we: build the PHP Xdebug extension ( pecl install xdebug ). configure in the container file /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/local-ixpmanager-xdebug.ini as follows: [xdebug] zend_extension=/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20151012/xdebug.so xdebug.remote_enable=1 xdebug.remote_port=9001 xdebug.remote_autostart=0 xdebug.idekey=PHPSTORM xdebug.profiler_enable=0 xdebug.profiler_enable_trigger=1 xdebug.profiler_output_dir=/srv/ixpmanager/storage/tmp xdebug.auto_trace=0 xdebug.trace_enable_trigger=1 xdebug.trace_output_dir=/srv/ixpmanager/storage/tmp Note that the zend_extension may change as it is dynamically set by the build script.

One key feature is PhpStorm's integration with PHP Xdebug. We of course also need this to work with Docker. Some background information on Xdebug is provided below but you are expected to be familiar with the Xdebug documentation on remote debugging . The way interactive remote debugging works with Xdebug is as follows: Enable remote debugging on the PHP server ( php.ini settings on the www container). Your browser, with a suitable plugin, includes a Xdebug parameter to signal you want remote debugging started for this request (either a GET, POST or Cookie setting). PHP Xdebug connects to the configured remote debugger (PhpStorm in our case) allowing you to set break points, step through instructions, view variable contents at a point in time, etc. To get this working with Docker, we need to work through each of these steps. 1. Enable Remote Debugging in the Docker Container If you examine the www container Dockerfile in the IXP Manager source under tools/docker/containers/www/Dockerfile , you will see that we: build the PHP Xdebug extension ( pecl install xdebug ). configure in the container file /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/local-ixpmanager-xdebug.ini as follows: [xdebug] zend_extension=/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20151012/xdebug.so xdebug.remote_enable=1 xdebug.remote_port=9001 xdebug.remote_autostart=0 xdebug.idekey=PHPSTORM xdebug.profiler_enable=0 xdebug.profiler_enable_trigger=1 xdebug.profiler_output_dir=/srv/ixpmanager/storage/tmp xdebug.auto_trace=0 xdebug.trace_enable_trigger=1 xdebug.trace_output_dir=/srv/ixpmanager/storage/tmp Note that the zend_extension may change as it is dynamically set by the build script. We also chose port 9001 rather than the default of 9000 due to local conflicts with common tool chains . The one key element that is missing in the INI is the remote debugger IP address . This needs to be set to your development computer's LAN address (there are other options but this works best in practice). Once you know this address (say it's 192.0.2.23 ), set the following in the ${IXPROOT}/.env : # For PHP xdebug, put in the IP address of your host DOCKER_XDEBUG_CONFIG_REMOTE_HOST=192.0.2.23 When you start the Docker environment from $IXPROOT using docker-compose with something like: cd $IXPROOT docker-compose -p ixpm up mysql www then docker-compose will use this setting from the .env file and it will be passed through the Xdebug. 2.

In older versions of IXP Manager (and as yet unupdated code), we used this Zend Framework trait to allow us to repidly deploy CRUD interfaces. For IXP Manager = v4.7, we have duplicated (and improved) this to create a scaffolding framework in Laravel. This page documents that class. Configuration \uf0c1 In any controller using extending the Doctrine2Frontend class, a _feInit() method is required which configures the controller and, for example, allows you to set what is displayed for different levels of user privileges. The primary purpose of this function is to define the anonymous object _feParams (using an object ensures that the view gets a reference to the object and not a copy of a static array at a point in time): ?php protected function _feInit() { $this- view- feParams = $this- _feParams = (object)[ // the ORM entity object that CRUD operations will affect: 'entity' = InfrastructureEntity::class, 'pagetitle' = 'Infrastructures', // default is false. If true, add / edit / delete will be disabled 'readonly' = false, 'titleSingular' = 'Infrastructure', 'nameSingular' = 'an infrastructure', 'viewFolderName' = 'infrastructure', 'readonly' = self::$read_only, 'listColumns' = [ // what columns to display in the list view 'id' = [ 'title' = 'DB ID', 'display' = true ], 'name' = 'Name', 'shortname' = 'Shortname' ], 'listOrderBy' = 'name', // how to order columns 'listOrderByDir' = 'ASC', // direction of order columns ]; // you can then override some of the above for different user privileges (for example) switch( Auth::user() ? Auth::user()- getPrivs() : UserEntity::AUTH_PUBLIC ) { case UserEntity::AUTH_SUPERUSER: $this- _feParams- pagetitle = 'Infrastructures (Superuser View)'; $this- _feParams- listColumns = array_merge( $this- _feParams- listColumns, [ // ... ]; ); break; default: if( php_sapi_name() !== \"cli\" ) { abort( 'error/insufficient-permissions' ); } } // display the same information in the single object view as the list of objects $this- _feParams- viewColumns = $this- _feParams- listColumns; } Access Privileges \uf0c1 By default, all Doctrine2Frontend controllers can only be accessed by an authenticated super user ( Entities\\User::AUTH_SUPERUSER ). You can change this by setting the following property on your implementation: ?php /** * The minimum privileges required to access this controller. * * If you set this to less than the superuser, you need to manage privileges and access * within your own implementation yourself. * * @var int */ public static $minimum_privilege = UserEntity::AUTH_SUPERUSER; If you set this to less than the superuser, you need to manage privileges and access within your own implementation yourself. This is normally handled in a number of ways: dedicated Request object utilising the authorize() method; additional middleware; per action basis; in feInit() The feInit() method would normally look something like the following: ?php // phpunit / artisan trips up here without the cli test: if( php_sapi_name() !== 'cli' ) { // custom access controls: switch( Auth::check() ? Auth::user()- getPrivs() : UserEntity::AUTH_PUBLIC ) { case UserEntity::AUTH_SUPERUSER: break; case UserEntity::AUTH_CUSTUSER: switch( Route::current()- getName() ) { case 'Layer2AddressController@forVlanInterface': break; default: $this- unauthorized(); } break; default: $this- unauthorized(); } } The $this- unauthorized( $url = '', $code = 302 ) calls abort() with the given redirect code and URL. The default parameters will do the right thing . Routing \uf0c1 Routes are explicitly defined in Laravel. The Doctrine2Frontend class sets up the standard routes automatically once you add the following to your routes/web.php (or as appropriate) file on a per implementation basis. E.g. for the Infrastructure implementation, we add to routes/web-doctrine2frontend.php : ?php IXP\\Http\\Controllers\\InfrastructureController::routes(); Note that by placing the above in routes/web-doctrine2frontend.php , you ensure the appropriate middleware is attached. This routes() function determines the route prefix using kebab case of the controller name. That is to say: if the controller is CustKitController , the determined prefix is cust-kit . You can override this by setting a $route_prefix class constant in your implementation. The standard routes added (using infrastructure as an example) are: GET infrastructure/add GET infrastructure/edit/{id} GET infrastructure/list GET infrastructure/view/{id} POST infrastructure/delete/{id} POST infrastructure/store If you want to create your own additional routes, create a function as follows in your implementation: ?php public static function additionalRoutes( $route_prefix ) {} And add routes (using the normal Route::get() / ::post() / etc Laravel methods). If you want to completely change the routes, just override the public static function routes() {} function. View Templates \uf0c1 All the common view templates for thss functionality can be found in resources/views/frontend directory. You can override any of these with your own by creating a template of the same name and placing it under resources/views/xxx (or resources/skins/skinname/xxx ) where xxx is the feParams['viewFolderName'] . Read Only \uf0c1 If your controller should be read only (list and view actions, no add, edit or delete) then set the following static member: ?php /** * Is this a read only controller? * * @var boolean */ public static $read_only = true; Actions \uf0c1 Each of the typical CRUD actions will be described here. NB: the best documentation is sometimes the code. Check out the above routes file ( routes/web-doctrine2frontend.php ) and examine some of the implemented controllers directly. List \uf0c1 The list action is for listing the contents of a database table in a HTML / DataTables view. The only requirement of the list action is that the following abstract function is implemented: ?php /** * Provide array of table rows for the list action (and view action) * * @param int $id The `id` of the row to load for `view` action. `null` if `list` action. * @return array */ abstract protected function listGetData( $id = null ); A sample implementation for the infrastructure controller just calls a Doctrine2 repository function: ?php protected function listGetData( $id = null ) { return D2EM::getRepository( InfrastructureEntity::class )- getAllForFeList( $this- feParams, $id ); } The table rows returned in the above array must be associatative arrays with keys matching the feParams['listColumns'] definition. The list view template optionally includes other templates you can define (where xxx below is the feParams['viewFolderName'] ): the list view includes a JavaScript template resources/views/frontend/js/list which activates the DataTables, sets up sorting, etc. You can override this (and include the original if appropriate) if you want to add additional JS functionality. if the resources/views/xxx/list-preamble template exists, it is included just before the table. if the resources/views/xxx/list-postamble template exists, it is included just after the table. if the resources/views/xxx/list-head-override template exists, it will replace the thead element of the list table ( example ). if the resources/views/xxx/list-head-override template exists, it will replace the tr elements of the list table ( example ). if the resources/views/xxx/list-empty-message template exists, it will replace the the standard information box when a table is empty ( example ). The following hooks are available: protected function preList():void {} - called before the list is displayed allowing you to add elements to the template, etc. View \uf0c1 The view action is for showing a single database row identified by the id passed in the URL. The only requirement of the view action is that the abstract function listGetData( $id = null ) as used by the list action has been correctly implemented to take an optional ID and return an array with a single element matching that ID. The table rows returned in the above array must be associatative arrays with keys matching the feParams['viewColumns'] definition. The list view template optionally includes other templates you can define (where xxx below is the feParams['viewFolderName'] ): an optional JavaScript template resources/views/frontend/js/view . if the resources/views/xxx/view-preamble template exists, it is included just before the view panel. if the resources/views/xxx/view-postamble template exists, it is included just after the view panel. if the resources/views/xxx/view-row-override template exists, it will replace the tr element of the view ( example ). Create / Update Form \uf0c1 The presentation of the create / update (also known as add / edit) page is discussed here. Form processing and storage will be dealt with in the next section. The first required element of this functionality is the implementation of the following abstract function: ?php abstract protected function addEditPrepareForm( $id = null ): array; The use of this function is best explained with reference to an implementation from the infrastructure controller: ?php /** * Display the form to add/edit an object * @param int $id ID of the row to edit * @return array */ protected function addEditPrepareForm( $id = null ): array { if( $id !== null ) { if( !( $this- object = D2EM::getRepository( InfrastructureEntity::class )- find( $id) ) ) { abort(404); } $old = request()- old(); // we use array_key_exists() here as the array can contain the // key with a null value. Former::populate([ 'name' = array_key_exists( 'name', $old ) ? $old['name'] : $this- object- getName(), 'shortname' = array_key_exists( 'shortname', $old ) ? $old['shortname'] : $this- object- getShortname(), 'isPrimary' = array_key_exists( 'isPrimary', $old ) ? $old['isPrimary'] : ( $this- object- getIsPrimary() ?? false ), ]); } return [ 'object' = $this- object, ]; } Note from the above: this function operates for add and edit. In the case of edit, it tries to load the appropriate object from the database. if it's an edit operation, the Former object is built up containing the existing objects details. you can pass back any data you wish in the returned array and it will be available via $t- params in the template. Note that $t- params['data'] is added later and contains the feParams object. The next required element is building the actual Former object for display. For this, you must create a custom resources/views/xxx/edit-form template. See, as an example, the infrastructure one under resources/views/infrastructure/edit-form.js . The add/edit view template optionally includes other templates you can define (where xxx below is the feParams['viewFolderName'] ): an optional JavaScript template resources/views/xxx/js/edit . if the resources/views/xxx/edit-preamble template exists, it is included just before the view panel. if the resources/views/xxx/edit-postamble template exists, it is included just after the view panel. You can query the boolean $t- params['isAdd'] in your templates to distinguish between add and edit operations. Create / Update Store \uf0c1 Storing the edited / new object requires implementing a single abstract method which manages validation and storage. This is best explained with a practical implementation: ?php /** * Function to do the actual validation and storing of the submitted object. * @param Request $request * @return bool|RedirectResponse */ public function doStore( Request $request ) { $validator = Validator::make( $request- all(), [ 'name' = 'required|string|max:255', 'shortname' = 'required|string|max:255', ]); if( $validator- fails() ) { return Redirect::back()- withErrors($validator)- withInput(); } if( $request- input( 'id', false ) ) { if( !( $this- object = D2EM::getRepository( InfrastructureEntity::class )- find( $request- input( 'id' ) ) ) ) { abort(404); } } else { $this- object = new InfrastructureEntity; D2EM::persist( $this- object ); } $this- object- setName( $request- input( 'name' ) ); $this- object- setShortname( $request- input( 'shortname' ) ); $this- object- setIxfIxId( $request- input( 'ixf_ix_id' ) ? $request- input( 'ixf_ix_id' ) : null ); $this- object- setPeeringdbIxId( $request- input( 'pdb_ixp' ) ? $request- input( 'pdb_ixp' ) : null ); $this- object- setIsPrimary( $request- input( 'primary' ) ?? false ); $this- object- setIXP( D2EM::getRepository( IXPEntity::class )- getDefault() ); D2EM::flush($this- object); if( $this- object- getIsPrimary() ) { // reset the rest: /** @var InfrastructureEntity $i */ foreach( D2EM::getRepository( InfrastructureEntity::class )- findAll() as $i ) { if( $i- getId() == $this- object- getId() || !$i- getIsPrimary() ) { continue; } $i- setIsPrimary( false ); } D2EM::flush(); } return true; } Note from this: validation is the standard Laravel validation which works well with Former . it's important to remember to assign the object as: $this- object = $inf; as it is used to create log messages, etc. The following hooks are available: protected function postStoreRedirect() {} - the Doctrine2Frontend class returns null. Override it to return a valid route name to have the post store redirect go somewhere besides /list . you can override the default Object added/edited success block by setting $this- store_alert_success_message (string) in doStore() . Delete \uf0c1 Deletes are handled via posts and so have Laravel's built in CSRF protection. The logic is quiet simple: ?php public function delete( Request $request ) { if( !( $this- object = D2EM::getRepository( $this- feParams- entity )- find( $request- input( 'id' ) ) ) ) { return abort( '404' ); } if( $this- preDelete() ) { D2EM::remove( $this- object ); D2EM::flush(); $this- postFlush( 'delete' ); AlertContainer::push( $this- feParams- titleSingular . \" deleted.\", Alert::SUCCESS ); } return redirect()- action( $this- feParams- defaultController.'@'.$this- feParams- defaultAction ); } As you can see, it calls a protected function preDelete(): bool {} hook which, if it returns false , the delete operation is abandoned. The following hooks are available: * `protected function postDeleteRedirect() {}` - the *Doctrine2Frontend* class returns null. Override it to return a valid route name to have the post store redirect go somewhere besides `/list`. Other Hooks \uf0c1 Post Flush \uf0c1 There is a postFlush() hook: ?php /** * Optional method to be overridden if a D2F controllers needs to perform post-database flush actions * * @param string $action Either 'add', 'edit', 'delete' * @return bool */ protected function postFlush( string $action ): bool { return true; } which is called during some actions with the action name as a parameter: add , edit , delete . This function is called just after the database flush operation.","title":"Frontend CRUD"},{"location":"dev/frontend-crud/#frontend-crud","text":"IXP Manager , like many applications, has a lot of tables that need basic CRUD access: CR eate, U pdate and D elete (plus list and view).

As an example, we would typically get the user's customer relation using $user- getCustomer() and this was linked via the user.custid column. In developing this enhancement, we needed to track two things: the customer the user was currently logged in for; the customer the user was last logged in for so on the next login, we could return to that customer by default. By using the user.custid for this purpose, we retained the ability to call $user- getCustomer() which meant the vast majority of existing code continued to work as expected.

AS112 is a service which provides anycast reverse DNS lookup for several prefixes, namely: 10.0.0.0/8 192.168.0.0/16 172.16.0.0/12 169.254.0.0/16 Because these IP addresses are widely used for private networking, many end-user systems are configured to perform reverse DNS lookups for these address ranges. DNS lookups for these ranges should always be null-answered quickly, in order to make sure that DNS retransmits don\u2019t occur (thereby overloading local DNS resolvers), and to prevent end-user systems from hanging due to DNS lookups. AS112 services are provided around the world by a group of volunteers and, very often, by IXP operators for the benefit of their members. INEX has always provided an AS112 service to our members on all peering LANs and so it is an integral part of IXP Manager . You can read all about INEX's implementation at https://www.inex.ie/technical/as112-service/ including graphs for the service. Feel free to use our test and examples from that page for your own IXP. Building an AS112 Service \uf0c1 You can find instructions for building an AS112 service in rfc7534 . You should also add AS112 redirection using DNAME functionality as per rfc7535 . You will also find a lot more information and how-tos on the official website at: https://www.as112.net/ . Follow these instructions in every way to build the AS112 service on a (virtual) machine with an appropriate DNS server - except skip the installation and configuration of the BGP daemon . When using IXP Manager, you will need to use Bird for this and IXP Manager will create the configuration. Managing Your AS112 Service from IXP Manager \uf0c1 AS112 is disabled by default in IXP Manager. This really just means UI elements are hidden. To enable these, set the following in your .env file: IXP_AS112_UI_ACTIVE=true This will add UI elements including: an AS112 Client checkbox on VLAN interface forms. Checking this toggles a database field to indicate if the customer's VLAN interface should have the AS112 service enabled. an indication as to whether the user has AS112 services enabled on various overview screens. Enabling the AS112 service simply indicates if a BGP peering session should be created in the AS112 BGP configuration when downloading the AS112 router's BGP configuration from IXP Manager. Creating the Pro-Bono AS112 Customer \uf0c1 You need to add the AS112 service as a pro-bono member of your IXP in IXP Manager. Here's INEX's example: You then need to create an interface for the AS112 service on each peering LAN where the service will be offered. Here again is INEX's example from our peering LAN1 in Dublin: Note that historically INEX has not used MD5 on our AS112 service. This is because the service dates from over 20 years ago at INEX when MD5 support was not available. There is no reason not to use MD5 on the service if you wish. Generating the Bird Configuration \uf0c1 Please see the router configuration generation for this. For your AS112 server, we have a sample script(s) for pulling and updating the configuration from IXP Manager. We typically put this in an hourly cron.

This will happen automatically if you check the Route Server Client on the AS112 VLAN interface configuration (see above screen shot) and also check the AS112 Client checkbox on the VLAN interfaces of your route servers in IXP Manager.

AS112 is a service which provides anycast reverse DNS lookup for several prefixes, namely: 10.0.0.0/8 192.168.0.0/16 172.16.0.0/12 169.254.0.0/16 Because these IP addresses are widely used for private networking, many end-user systems are configured to perform reverse DNS lookups for these address ranges. DNS lookups for these ranges should always be null-answered quickly, in order to make sure that DNS retransmits don\u2019t occur (thereby overloading local DNS resolvers), and to prevent end-user systems from hanging due to DNS lookups. AS112 services are provided around the world by a group of volunteers and, very often, by IXP operators for the benefit of their members. INEX has always provided an AS112 service to our members on all peering LANs and so it is an integral part of IXP Manager .

These IP addresses can show up in traceroutes (for example) and both IXPs and customers like to have these resolve to a hostname. When creating VLAN Interfaces in IXP Manager there is a field called IPv[4/6] Hostname . This is intended for this DNS ARPA purpose. Some customers have specific requirements for these while other smaller customers may not fully understand the use cases. At INEX, we typically default to entries such as: customer-name.v4.example.com (where example.com would be inex.ie in our case) customer-name.v6.example.com IXP Manager can generate your ARPA DNS entries for your peering IP space as per the hostnames configured on each VLAN interface and provide them in two ways: as JSON; as text based on a template (IXP Manager comes with a ISC Bind format example) Both of these are explained below. Note that the API endpoints below can be tested in your browser by directly accessing the URLs when logged in . Otherwise, you need an API key when using them in scripts. As JSON \uf0c1 You can use the IXP Manager API to get all ARPA entries for a given VLAN and protocol as a JSON object using the following endpoint format: https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/dns/arpa/{vlanid}/{protocol} where: vlanid is the database ID ( DB ID ) of the VLAN. You can find the DB ID in IXP Manager in the VLAN table (select VLANs from the left hand side menu). protocol is either 4 for IPv4 or 6 for IPv6 . If either of these are invalid, the API will return with a HTTP 404 response. And example of the JSON response returned is: [ { \"enabled\": true, \"address\": \"192.0.2.67\", \"hostname\": \"cherrie.example.com\", \"arpa\": \"67.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.\" }, ... ] where: enabled indicates if the protocol has been enabled for this user. This is nearly always true. A situation where it may be false is if you enabled IPv6 for a user; then that user subsequently decided to not use IPv6; then you unchecked the IPv6 Enabled box in the VLAN Interface form without removing address / hostname entries. address - this IPv4/6 address of the VLAN interface as assigned by the IXP. hostname - the configured hostname for this address as entered into IXP Manager . arpa : the generated ARPA record name for the IP address assigned by the IXP. You can now feed the JSON object into a script to create your own DNS zones appropriate to your DNS infrastructure. When scripting, we would normally pull the JSON object using something like: #! /usr/bin/env bash KEY=\"your-ixp-manager-api-key\" URL=\"https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/dns/arpa\" VLANIDS=\"1 2\" PROTOCOLS=\"4 6\" for v in $VLANIDS; do for p in $PROTOCOLS; do cmd=\"/usr/local/bin/curl --fail -s \\ -H \\\"X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: ${KEY}\\\" \\ ${URL}/${v}/${p} \\ /tmp/dns-arpa-vlanid$v-ipv$p.json.$$\" eval $cmd if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then echo \"ERROR: non-zero return from DNS ARPA API call for vlan ID $v with protocol $p\" continue fi // do something rm /tmp/dns-arpa-vlanid$v-ipv$p.json.$$ done done From Templates \uf0c1 Rather than writing your own scripts to consume the JSON object as above, it may be easier to use the bundled ISC Bind templates or to write your own template for IXP Manager. You can use the IXP Manager API to get all ARPA entries for a given VLAN and protocol as plain text based on a template by using the following API endpoint: https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/dns/arpa/{vlanid}/{protocol}/{template} where: vlanid and protocol is as above in As JSON . template is the name of a template file residing in the view path api/v4/dns/ . Remember that the included ISC Bind templates can be skinned or you can add custom templates to your skin directory. More detail on this can be found in the dedicated section below. The bundled ISC Bind templates can be used by setting {template} to bind or bind-full in the above URL. For the example interface in the JSON above, the ISC Bind bind template would yield: 67.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR cherrie.example.com. (note that the terminated period on the hostname is added by the template) The two bundled templates are: bind : outputs resource records only as per the above example. bind-full : outputs a complete Bind zone file including head and serialized serial number (UNIX timestamp). This must be templated as it uses example.com for email and name server domains. Skinning / Templating \uf0c1 You can use skinning to make changes to the bundled ISC Bind template or add your own. Let's say you wanted to add your own template called mytemplate1 and your skin is named myskin . The best way to proceed is to copy the bundled example: cd $IXPROOT mkdir -p resources/skins/myskin/api/v4/dns cp resources/views/api/v4/dns/bind.foil.php resources/skins/myskin/api/v4/dns/mytemplate1.foil.php You can now edit this template as required. The only constraint on the template name is it can only contain characters from the classes a-z, 0-9, - . NB: do not use uppercase characters. Contribute back - if you write a useful generator, please open a pull request and contribute it back to the project. The following variables are available in the template: $t- arpa : array of the ARPA entries - see below. $t- vlan : instance of the Vlan entity object . $t- protocol : either 4 or 6 . The following variables are available for each element of the $t- arpa array (essentially the same as the JSON object above): enabled, hostname, address, arpa . See above for a description.

One requirement for our replacement was a decent API and with Zendesk's API we were able to migrate all our old tickets using this script .","title":"Implementation Development"},{"location":"features/irrdb/","text":"IRRDB Prefixes and ASN Filtering \uf0c1 Prerequisite Reading: Ensure you first familiarize yourself with the generic documentation on managing and generating router configurations here .

Historical reference: INEX created and hosted a proof of concept directory for the IX-F Export Schema until Euro-IX/IX-F took it in house in 2018. The key element of the IX-F Member Export is it makes you, the individual IXP, the canonical trusted source for data about your own IXP . Data that has the best chance of being correct and up to date. Particularly, PeeringDB has the option of allowing network data to be updated from IX records - see our documentation on this here . To find out more about the JSON schema and see examples, you can read more here , explore many of the public IXP end points available here or see the GitHub euro-ix/json-schemas repository. IXP Manager supports the IX-F Member List Export out of the box. It previously supported all versions from 0.3 to 0.5 but we now only support 0.6, 0.7 and 1.0 (for =v5.1). We plan to deprecate support for 0.6 during 2019. Sometimes you may need something more customized than the the IX-F Member Export. For that, see the other member export feature if IXP Manager. Preparing the IX-F Member Export \uf0c1 There are a small number of things you should do to ensure your IX-F export is correct. Correctly set the PeeringDB ID and IX-F ID The first is to ensure you have correctly set the PeeringDB ID and IX-F ID in your infrastructure (see Infrastructures under the left hand side IXP ADMIN ACTIONS menu). The IX-F ID is mandatory. You will find yours by searching the IX-F providers database here . If you are a new IXP that is not registered here, please email your IXP's: full name, short name, city / region / country, GPS co-ordinates and website URL to ixpdb-admin (at) euro-ix (dot) net so they can register it in the IXPDB. Create Network Info From IXP Manager v4.9 and above, click VLANs on the left-hand-side menu and then chose Network Information . Once there, add the network address and network mask length for IPv4 and IPv6 for your peering LAN(s). Prior to v4.9, this was a little hacky: there is a database table called networkinfo that requires you to manually insert some detail on your peering LAN. The first thing you need is the peering VLAN DB ID. [clarification note: this is nothing to do with PeeringDB but the VLAN created within IXP Manager]. For this, select VLANs under the left hand side IXP ADMIN ACTIONS menu in IXP Manager. Locate your peering VLAN DB ID and note it. For our example, we will use the following sample data: Peering VLAN DB ID : 66 IPv4 peering network: 192.0.2.0/25 with route servers on .8 and .9 IPv6 peering network: 2001:db8:1000::/64 with route servers on .8 and .9 You need need to add this data to networkinfo with the following sample SQL commands: INSERT INTO `networkinfo` ( `vlanid`, `protocol`, `network`, `masklen`, `rs1address`, `rs2address`), VALUES ( 66, 4, '192.0.2.0', '25', '192.0.2.8', '192.0.2.9' ); INSERT INTO `networkinfo` ( `vlanid`, `protocol`, `network`, `masklen`, `rs1address`, `rs2address`), VALUES ( 66, 6, '2001:db8:1000::', '64', '2001:db8:1000::8', '2001:db8:1000::9' ); Set Your IXP's Name / Country / etc The third task is to ensure your IXP's details are correct in the IX-F export. You will most likely have nothing to do here as it would have been done on installation but this reference may prove useful if there are any issues. These are mostly set in the .env file (as well as some other places) and the following table shows how they get mapped to the IX-F Export: IX-F Export IXP Element How to Set in IXP Manager shortname In IXP Manager, from the Infrastructure object name field name IDENTITY_LEGALNAME from .env country IDENTITY_COUNTRY from .env in 2-letter ISO2 format url IDENTITY_CORPORATE_URL from .env peeringdb_id In IXP Manager, from the Infrastructure object ixf_id In IXP Manager, from the Infrastructure object support_email IDENTITY_SUPPORT_EMAIL from .env support_phone IDENTITY_SUPPORT_PHONE from .env support_contact_hours IDENTITY_SUPPORT_HOURS from .env emergency_email IDENTITY_SUPPORT_EMAIL from .env emergency_phone IDENTITY_SUPPORT_PHONE from .env emergency_contact_hours IDENTITY_SUPPORT_HOURS from .env billing_email IDENTITY_BILLING_EMAIL billing_phone IDENTITY_BILLING_PHONE billing_contact_hours IDENTITY_BILLING_HOURS We we say from the Infrastructure object above, we mean that when you are logged into IXP Manager as an admin, it's the Infrastructures menu option under IXP Admin Actions on the left hand side. Accessing the IX-F Member List \uf0c1 If your version of IXP Manager is installed at, say, https://ixp.example.com/ , then the IX-F Member List export can be accessed at: https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/member-export/ixf/1.0 where 1.0 is a version parameter which allows for support of potential future versions. Note that the publicly accessible version does not include individual member details such as name, max prefixes, contact email and phone, when the member joined, member's web address, peering policy, NOC website, NOC hours or member type. This information is available to any logged in users or users querying the API with an API key . Registering Your API Endpoint With IXPDB \uf0c1 IXPDB requires two pieces of information to fully integrate with the IXPDB. You can provide this information to ixpdb-admin (at) euro-ix (dot) net or - if you have a login to the Euro-IX website, you should be able to login and edit your own IXP directly on IXPDB. The first element needed is the API endpoint as described above in Accessing the IX-F Member List . The second is the API endpoint to export your statistics. This is: https://ixp.example.com/grapher/infrastructure?id=1 type=log period=day where id=1 is the infrastructure DB ID (see Infrastructures under the left hand side IXP ADMIN ACTIONS menu). Configuration Options \uf0c1 To disable public access to the restricted member export, set the following in your .env file: IXP_API_JSONEXPORTSCHEMA_PUBLIC=false We strongly advise you not to disable public access if you are a standard IXP. Remember, the public version is essentially the same list as you would provide on your standard website's list of members. In addition, membership of an IXP is easily discernible from a number of other sources including: PeeringDB Route collectors (your own, PCH, members\u2019 own, ...) Looking glasses Traceroutes (and tools such as: https://www.inex.ie/ard/ ) RIPE RRCs / RIS, RIPE Atlas Commercial products (Noction, ...) Leave public access available, own your own data, ensure it's validity and advertise it! If you must disable public access but would still like to provide IX-F (or others) with access, you can set a static access key in your .env file such as: IXP_API_JSONEXPORTSCHEMA_ACCESS_KEY=\"super-secret-access-key\" and then provide the URL in the format: https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/member-export/ixf/1.0?access_key=super-secret-access-key If you wish to control access to the infrastructure statistics, see the Grapher API documentation . The statistics data is a JSON object representing each line of a the rest of the file from a standard MRTG log file . This means the per-line array elements are: The Unix timestamp for the point in time the data on this line is relevant. The average incoming transfer rate in bytes per second. This is valid for the time between the A value of the current line and the A value of the previous line. The average outgoing transfer rate in bytes per second since the previous measurement. The maximum incoming transfer rate in bytes per second for the current interval. This is calculated from all the updates which have occurred in the current interval. If the current interval is 1 hour, and updates have occurred every 5 minutes, it will be the biggest 5 minute transfer rate seen during the hour. The maximum outgoing transfer rate in bytes per second for the current interval. Example: Member Lists \uf0c1 A common requirement of IXPs is to create a public member list on their official website. This can be done with the IX-F Member Export quite easily. The below HTML and JavaScript is a way to do it with INEX's endpoint. There's a live JSFiddle which demonstrates this also - https://jsfiddle.net/barryo/2tzuypf9/ .

Outside of our automation and VXLAN, other uses included: to potentially allow members to add a MAC address during maintenance and thus have the system update a layer2 acl on the switch(es); a static maintained database of MAC addresses for EVPN; a static maintained database for lookups. The features of this system are listed below. Listing and Searching Existing Configured MAC Addresses \uf0c1 There is a new menu option (left hand side menu) under MAC Addresses called Configured Addresses . This lists all configured MAC addresses including the OUI manufacturer (see below), associated switch / switch port(s), customer name, IPv4 and v6 addresses. You can also: as-you-type search from the datatable search box (lowercased and filtered to a normalised MAC address); restrict the view to a single VLAN; action-to-move to layer 2 address add / edit / delete for a given VLAN interface; click on a MAC to bring up a pop-up, allowing you to copy in different formats: Adding / Removing Layer2 Addresses to/from a VLAN Interface \uf0c1 When editing a customer's interface in the usual manner (customer overview - Ports - edit button), you will now see MAC address(es) under VLAN Interfaces : In the event that there is zero or more than one MAC address, the MAC address demonstrated above will be replaced with an appropriate note to indicate this. Clicking on the MAC address (or note when none / multiple) will bring you to the configured MAC address management page for this VLAN interface. Addresses can be added / removed on this page. MAC addresses can be entered in either upper or lower cases and can optionally include characters such as . , : , - . These are all stripped before validation and insertion. Extracting Addresses \uf0c1 As automation features are still a work in progress, not all methods are listed here. Please open an issue on GitHub or start a discussion on the mailing list for whatever methods you would like. Currently implemented (see the API page for access details ): An API to be used by the sflow / peer to peer graphing tool: Virtual Interface ID to MAC address - GET request to: https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/vlan-interface/sflow-mac-table Virtual Interface ID, VLAN interface ID, customer name and VLAN tag - GET request to: https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/vlan-interface/sflow-matrix YAML export for automated provisioning. As yet undocumented and not suitable for general use. Querying the database directly. Not usually recommended as the schema may change. Migrating Discovered MACs to Configured MACs \uf0c1 INEX's use case was to switch from the discovered MAC addresses table to the configured MAC addresses table without the need to data fill all preexisting ~200 MACs. As such we have created an Artisan migration script which can be run with: php $IXPROOT/artisan l2addresses:populate You will be prompted as follows: Are you sure you wish to proceed? This command will CLEAR the layer2address table and then copy addresses from the read-only macaddress table. Generally, this command should only ever be run once when initially populating the new table. One thing to note: as the discovered MAC Addresses table is per virtual interface and the new configured MAC address functionality is per VLAN interface, any MAC from discovered MAC Addresses that is populated into confifured MAC Addresses will be populated for every VLAN interface associated with the virtual interface. The script prints notices for these such as: Created 1 layer2address for [member name]] with virtual interface: https://www.example.com/ixp/virtual-interface/edit/id/235 The inclusion of the URL makes it easy to double check the result. For obvious reasons, we only allow a single / unique layer2 address per VLAN. In the event that the script tries to add the same MAC more than once, it will print: Could not add additional instance of 001122334455 for [Customer]] with virtual interface: https://www.example.com/ixp/virtual-interface/edit/id/265 as it already exists in this Vlan [VLAN name] These should all be checked manually. A useful SQL command to double check the results for me was: SELECT mac, COUNT(mac) AS c FROM l2address GROUP BY mac HAVING COUNT(mac) 1; Discovered MAC Addresses \uf0c1 This was the original functionality - a read-only table via an admin menu option called MAC Addresses - Discovered Addresses which lists entries from a database of MAC addresses which are sourced via a script from the IXP's switches directly. At an IXP, it can be extremely useful to have a quick look up table to see what member owns what MAC address - especially when they start injecting illegal packets into the exchange fabric. We have a script, update-l2database.pl , for this. To set it up (using Ubuntu as an example), proceed as below. We are in the process of trying to reduce the reliance on the perl library and direct database access. But for now, this script still requires it. # If you haven't already, install the Perl library for IXP Manager: apt-get install libnet-snmp-perl libconfig-general-perl libnetaddr-ip-perl cd $IXPROOT/tools/perl-lib/IXPManager perl Makefile.PL make install # Then copy and edit the configuration file to set the database connection settings: cp $IXPROOT/tools/perl-lib/IXPManager/ixpmanager.conf /usr/local/etc/ joe /usr/local/etc/ixpmanager.conf #and set database settings # Now copy the script: cp $IXPROOT/tools/runtime/l2database/update-l2database.pl /usr/local/bin # and then add it to your periodic cron job with: /usr/local/bin/update-l2database.pl OUI Database \uf0c1 IXP Manager can store the IEEE OUI database and reference it to show the manufacturer behind a MAC address. Populating and Updating the OUI Database \uf0c1 The OUI is updated weekly by the task scheduler . You can force an update with the following Artisan command: php $IXPROOT/artisan utils:oui-update which will populate / update the OUI database directly from the latest IEEE file from their website. A specific file can be passed via the file parameter. You can also force a database reset (drop all OUI entries and re-populate) via the --refresh option. Neither of these options are typically necessary. End User Access \uf0c1 In v4.7.3 we introduced the ability for logged in users to management their own configured MAC addresses. This is disabled by default but can be enabled with the following .env settings: # Set this to allow customers to change their own configured MAC addresses: IXP_FE_LAYER2_ADDRESSES_CUST_CAN_EDIT=true # The following defaults are configured for min/max MAC addresses IXP_FE_LAYER2_ADDRESSES_CUST_PARAMS_MIN_ADDRESSES=1 IXP_FE_LAYER2_ADDRESSES_CUST_PARAMS_MAX_ADDRESSES=2 When a MAC is added, a IXP\\Events\\Layer2Address\\Added event is triggered and, similarly, when a MAC is deleted a IXP\\Events\\Layer2Address\\Deleted event is triggered. We have created an event listener for these to fire off an email in both cases. To enable this listener, set the following .env settings: # Trigger an email when a superuser adds/deletes a MAC: IXP_FE_LAYER2_ADDRESSES_EMAIL_ON_SUPERUSER_CHANGE=true # Trigger an email when a customer user adds/deletes a MAC: IXP_FE_LAYER2_ADDRESSES_EMAIL_ON_CUSTOMER_CHANGE=true # Destination address of the email: IXP_FE_LAYER2_ADDRESSES_EMAIL_ON_CHANGE_DEST=ops@ixp.example.net There are two files you can consider skinning with this functionality: resources/views/layer2-address/emails/changed.blade.php - the email which is sent when a MAC is added / removed. resources/views/layer2-address/customer-edit-msg.foil.php - an informational alert box that is shown to the customer on the MAC add/delete page to set their expectations on time to complete on the IXP end.","title":"MAC Addresses"},{"location":"features/layer2-addresses/#mac-addresses","text":"IXP Manager has support for layer2 / MAC addresses in two ways: Discovered Addresses : a read-only table via an admin menu option called MAC Addresses - Discovered Addresses which lists entries from a database of MAC addresses which are sourced via a script from the IXP's switches directly.

A fully working example of this can be seen here on INEX's IXP Manager . Enabling the looking glass just requires: properly configured router(s) . for routers that Bird and where you want them to be available via a looking glass, install Bird's Eye on the same server(s) running Bird. the API endpoint must be accessible from the server running IXP Manager and this endpoint must be set correctly in the router's configuration (see router(s) page) (along with an appropriate setting for LG Access Privileges ). Note that the Birdseye API end points do not need to be publicly accessible - just from the IXP Manager server. set the .env option: IXP_FE_FRONTEND_DISABLED_LOOKING_GLASS=false (in IXP Manager's .env and add it if it's missing as it defaults to true ). Choose the Correct Version of Bird's Eye to Use \uf0c1 For IXP Manager v4.x.y, choose the latest version of Bird's Eye v1.1.x . For IXP Manager v5.x.y, choose the latest version of Bird's Eye v1.2.x . The looking glass will not work if the versions are not matched correctly as above. Example Router Configuration \uf0c1 See this screenshot for an appropriately configured INEX router with Bird's Eye: Looking Glass 'Pass Thru' API Calls \uf0c1 Depending on the configured LG Access Privileges for a given router, IXP Manager will pass thru the following API calls to the router API. https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/lg/{handle}/status https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/lg/{handle}/bgp-summary and return the JSON result. The rationale for this is that we expect most IX's to keep direct access to looking glass implementations on internal / private networks. Here are two live examples from INEX: https://www.inex.ie/ixp/api/v4/lg/rc1-cork-ipv4/status https://www.inex.ie/ixp/api/v4/lg/rc1-cork-ipv4/bgp-summary You can see all of INEX 's looking glasses at https://www.inex.ie/ixp/lg . GRNET have also a public IXP Manager integration at: https://portal.gr-ix.gr/lg . Debugging \uf0c1 Generally speaking, if you carefully read the above and the Bird's Eye README file , you should be able to get IXP Manager / Bird's Eye integration working. If you do not, try all of the following and solve any elements that fail. If you still have issues, email the IXP Manager mailing list with the output of all of the following commands from both sections .

The following sections explain the steps in how this is set up. NB: This facility does not perform a 100% synchronisation. Any mailing list members that are added separately without a matching user in IXP Manager are not interfered with. Configuring Available Mailing Lists \uf0c1 There is a sample configuration file which you need to copy as follows: cd $IXPROOT cp config/mailinglists.php.dist config/mailinglists.php You then need to edit this file as follows: Enable the mailing list functionality by setting this to true: // Set the following to 'true' to enable mailing list functionality: 'enabled' = true, If this is not set to true, the user will not be offered subscription options and the CLI/API commands will not execute. Configure the available mailing list(s) in the lists array. Here is an example: 'lists' = [ 'members' = [ 'name' = \"Members' Mailing List\", 'desc' = \"A longer description as presented in IXP Manager.\", 'email' = \"members@example.com\", 'archive' = \"https://www.example.com/mailman/private/members/\", ], 'tech' = [ 'name' = \"Tech/Operations Mailing List\", 'desc' = \"A longer description as presented in IXP Manager.\", 'email' = \"tech@example.com\", 'archive' = \"https://www.example.com/mailman/private/tech/\", ], ], Note that the members and tech array keys above are the list handles that will be used by the API interfaces later. It is also important that they match the Mailman list key. Historically, mailing list passwords were also sync'd from the IXP Manager user database unless syncpws is both defined and false for the given list. As we are now enforcing bcrypt as the standard password hashing mechanism, we no longer support this and suggest allowing Mailman to manage its own passwords. Paths to Mailman commands. These will be used in the API/CLI elements later: 'mailman' = [ 'cmds' = [ 'list_members' = \"/usr/local/mailman/bin/list_members\", 'add_members' = \"/usr/local/mailman/bin/add_members -r - -w n -a n\", 'remove_members' = \"/usr/local/mailman/bin/remove_members -f - -n -N\", 'changepw' = \"/usr/local/mailman/bin/withlist -q -l -r changepw\" ] ] Explanation of Usage \uf0c1 This mailing list synchronisation / integration code was written for existing Mailman lists we have at INEX where some lists are public with subscribers that will never have an account on INEX's IXP Manager. As such, these scripts are written so that email addresses in common between IXP Manager and Mailman can manage their subscriptions in IXP Manager but those other subscribers will be unaffected. Users in IXP Manager will either be marked as being subscribed to a list, not subscribed to a list or neither (i.e. a new user). Subscriptions are managed by user preferences (in the database) of the format: mailinglist.listname1.subscribed = 0/1 There are three steps to performing the synchronisation for each list which are done by either using the IXP Manager CLI script artisan mailing-list:... or the API interface. CLI Interface Overview \uf0c1 NB: these relate to the CLI as implemented from IXP Manager = v4.7. The execution of the artisan mailing-list:init script which is really for new IXP Manager users (or initial set up of the mailing list feature). This script is piped the full subscribers list from Mailman (via list_members ). This function will iterate through all users and, if they have no preference set for subscription to this list, will either add a \"not subscribed\" preference if their email address is not in the provided list of subscribers or a \"subscribed\" preference if it is. The execution of the artisan mailing-list:get-subscribers action which lists all users who are subscribed to the given mailing list based on their user preferences. This is piped to the add_members Mailman script. The execution of the artisan mailing-list:get-subscribers --unsubscribed action which lists all users who are unsubscribed to the given mailing list based on their user preferences. This is piped to the remove_members Mailman script. API V4 Interface Overview \uf0c1 The API v4 implementation was added in IXP Manager v4.7. See the end of this document for the API v1 implementation in previous versions of IXP Manager. If you wish to use the API version, proceed as follows where: $KEY is one of your SUPERUSER API keys (see here for details); https://ixp.example.com is your IXP Manager web interface; members is an example mailing list handle as defined above in $IXPROOT/config/mailinglists.php . Use the initialisation function for new IXP Manager users (or initial set up of the mailing list feature) which updates IXP Manager with all currently subscribed mailing list members: /path/to/mailman/bin/list_members members /tmp/ml-members.txt curl -f --data-urlencode addresses@/tmp/ml-members.txt \\ -H \"X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: $KEY\" -X POST \"https://ixp.example.co/api/v4/mailing-list/init/members\" rm /tmp/ml-members.txt Pipe all subscribed users to the add_members Mailman script: curl -f -H \"X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: $KEY\" -X GET \\ \"https://ixp.example.co/api/v4/mailing-list/subscribers/members\" | \\ /path/to/mailman/bin/add_members -r - -w n -a n members /dev/null Pipe all users who are unsubscribed to the remove_members Mailman script: curl -f -H \"X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: $KEY\" -X GET \\ \"https://ixp.example.co/api/v4/mailing-list/unsubscribed/members\" | \\ /path/to/mailman/bin/remove_members -f - -n -N members /dev/null How to Implement \uf0c1 You can implement mailing list management by configuring IXP Manager as above. IXP Manager will generate shell scripts to manage all of the above. Execute the following command for the CLI version (and make sure to update the assignments at the top of the script) : artisan mailing-list:sync-script --sh Or the following for the API V4 version (and make sure to update the assignments at the top of the script) : artisan mailing-list:sync-script This generates a script which performs each of the above four steps for each configured mailing list. If your mailing list configuration does not change, you will not need to rerun this. You should now put this script into crontab on the appropriate server (same server for CLI!) and run as often as you feel is necessary. The current success message for a user updating their subscriptions says within 12 hours so we'd recommend at least running twice a day.

We even provide examples of how to use this to create example tables. However, you may sometimes require additional flexibility which necessitates rolling your own export templates. This Member Export feature will allow you to do this but it does require some PHP programming ability . This Member Export feature is modeled after the static content tool and you are advised to read that page also. This feature first appears in v4.8.0 and replaces the deprecated older way of handling this . Overview \uf0c1 In IXP Manager, there are four types of users as described in the users page . Member export templates can be added which requires a minimum user privilege to access (e.g. priv == 0 would be publicly accessible through to priv == 3 which would require a superadmin). To create your own member export templte, you should first set up skinning for your installation. Let's assume you called your skin example in the following. To create a publicly accessible member export page called lonap , you would first create a directory structure in your skin as follows: cd ${IXPROOT} mkdir -p resources/skins/example/content/members/{0,1,2,3} where the directories 0, 1, 2, 3 represent the minimum required user privilege to access the template. You can now create your export template page by creating a file: resources/skins/example/content/members/0/lonap.foil.php and then edit that page. In fact, we have bundled three examples in the following locations: resources/skins/example/content/members/3/lonap.foil.php : a table that replicates how LONAP have traditionally listed their members ( see here ). It would be accessed via: https://ixp.example.com/content/members/3/lonap resources/skins/example/content/members/3/json-example.foil.php : a JSON example of the above. The HTTP response content type is set to JSON with .json is added to the URL. However you have to ensure your template outputs JSON also. This would be accessed via: https://ixp.example.com/content/members/3/json-example.json resources/skins/inex/content/members/0/list.foil.php : what we at INEX use to generate this members list .

Member export templates can be added which requires a minimum user privilege to access (e.g. priv == 0 would be publicly accessible through to priv == 3 which would require a superadmin). To create your own member export templte, you should first set up skinning for your installation. Let's assume you called your skin example in the following. To create a publicly accessible member export page called lonap , you would first create a directory structure in your skin as follows: cd ${IXPROOT} mkdir -p resources/skins/example/content/members/{0,1,2,3} where the directories 0, 1, 2, 3 represent the minimum required user privilege to access the template. You can now create your export template page by creating a file: resources/skins/example/content/members/0/lonap.foil.php and then edit that page. In fact, we have bundled three examples in the following locations: resources/skins/example/content/members/3/lonap.foil.php : a table that replicates how LONAP have traditionally listed their members ( see here ).

IXP Manager can generate configuration to monitor the above for you. NB: IXP Manager will not install and configure Nagios from scratch. You need a working Nagios installation first and then IXP Manager will automate the above areas of the configuration. Historical Notes \uf0c1 If you have used Nagios on IXP Manager 4.5, then how the configuration is generated has changed. The older documentation may be available here . In previous versions of IXP Manager, we generated entire / monolithic Nagios configuration files. We have found in practice that this does not scale well and creates a number of limitations. IXP Manager = v4.5 now simply creates the targets on a per VLAN and protocol basis. Sample Scripts \uf0c1 You will find sample scripts for pulling Nagios configuration from IXP Manager and reloading Nagios at: https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/tree/master/tools/runtime/nagios Monitoring Member Reachability \uf0c1 We monitor all member router interfaces (unless asked not to) via ICMP[v6] pings with Nagios. This is all controlled by the Nagios configuration created with this feature. To enable / disable these checks, edit the VLAN interface configuration and set IPvX Can Ping appropriately. Note that when IPvX Can Ping is disabled, the host definition is created anyway as this would be used for other Nagios checks such as route collector sessions. There is an additional option when editing a member's VLAN interface called Busy Host . This changes the Nagios ping fidelity from 250.0,20%!500.0,60% to 1000.0,80%!2000.0,90% (using the default object definitions which are configurable). This is useful for routers with slow / rate limited control planes. Members are added to a number of hostgroups also: a per-switch hostgroup; a per cabinet hostgroup; a per location / data centre hostgroup; an all members hostgroup. These hostgroups are very useful to single out issues and for post-maintenance checks. You can use the IXP Manager API to get the Nagios configuration for a given VLAN and protocol using the following endpoint format (both GET and POST requests work): https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/nagios/customers/{vlanid}/{protocol} where: vlanid is the database ID ( DB ID ) of the VLAN. You can find the DB ID in IXP Manager in the VLAN table (select VLANs from the left hand side menu). protocol is either 4 for IPv4 or 6 for IPv6 . If either of these are invalid, the API will return with a HTTP 404 response. And example of a target in the reponse is: ############################################################################################### ### ### Packet Clearing House DNS ### ### Equinix DB2 (Kilcarbery) / Packet Clearing House DNS / swi1-kcp1-1. ### ### Host: 185.6.36.60 / inex.woodynet.net / Peering VLAN #1. define host { use ixp-manager-member-host host_name packet-clearing-house-dns-as42-ipv4-vlanid2-vliid109 alias Packet Clearing House DNS / swi1-kcp1-1 / Peering VLAN #1. address 185.6.36.60 } ### Service: 185.6.36.60 / inex.woodynet.net / Peering VLAN #1. define service { use ixp-manager-member-ping-service host_name packet-clearing-house-dns-as42-ipv4-vlanid2-vliid109 } Configuring Nagios for Member Reachability \uf0c1 You will notice that the above configuration example is very light and is missing an awful lot of Nagios required configuration directives. This is intentional so that IXP Manager is not too prescriptive and allows you to define your own Nagios objects without having to resort to skinning IXP Manager. Two of the most important elements of Nagios configuration which you need to understand are object definitions and object inheritance . You can pass three optional parameters to Nagios via GET/POST and these are: host_definition ; defaults to: ixp-manager-member-host . service_definition ; defaults to ixp-manager-member-service . ping_service_definition ; defaults to: ixp-manager-member-ping-service . ping_busy_service_definition ; defaults to: ixp-manager-member-ping-busy-service . An example of changing two of these parameters is: curl --data \"host_definition=my-host-def service_definition=my-service-def\" -X POST \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\ -H \"X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\" \\ https://ixpexample.com/api/v4/nagios/customers/2/4 An example of the three objects that INEX use for this are: define host { name ixp-manager-member-host check_command check-host-alive check_period 24x7 max_check_attempts 10 notification_interval 120 notification_period 24x7 notification_options d,u,r contact_groups admins register 0 } define service { name ixp-manager-member-service check_period 24x7 max_check_attempts 10 check_interval 5 retry_check_interval 1 contact_groups admins notification_interval 120 notification_period 24x7 notification_options w,u,c,r register 0 } define service { name ixp-manager-member-ping-service use ixp-manager-member-service service_description PING check_command check_ping!250.0,20%!500.0,60% register 0 } define service { name ixp-manager-member-ping-busy-service use ixp-manager-member-service service_description PING-Busy check_command check_ping!1000.0,80%!2000.0,90% register 0 } Templates / Skinning \uf0c1 You can use skinning to make changes to the bundled default template or, preferably , add your own. Let's say you wanted to add your own template called mytemplate1 and your skin is named myskin . The best way to proceed is to copy the bundled example: cd $IXPROOT mkdir -p resources/skins/myskin/api/v4/nagios/customers cp resources/views/api/v4/nagios/customers/default.foil.php resources/skins/myskin/api/v4/nagios/customers/mytemplate1.foil.php You can now edit this template as required. The only constraint on the template name is it can only contain characters from the classes a-z, 0-9, - . NB: do not use uppercase characters. You can then elect to use this template by tacking the name onto the API request: https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/nagios/customers/{vlanid}/{protocol}/{template} where, in this example, {template} would be: mytemplate1 . As a policy, INEX tends to use the bundled templates and as such they should be fit for general purpose. Switch Monitoring \uf0c1 We monitor all production peering LAN switches for a number of difference services (see below). IXP Manager produces a host configuration for each production switch such as: # # swi2-dc1-1 - DUB01.XX.YY.ZZ, Data Centre DUB1. # define host { use ixp-manager-production-switch host_name swi2-dc1-1.mgmt.inex.ie alias swi2-dc1-1 address 192.0.2.4 } Members are added to a number of hostgroups also: switches per location / data centre; all switches in the requested infrastructure; grouped by vendor name (the vendor's shortname as defined in IXP Manager); grouped by vendor model (as discovered by SNMP). These hostgroups are very useful when defining service checks. You can use the IXP Manager API to get the Nagios configuration for a given infrastructure using the following endpoint format (both GET and POST requests work): https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/nagios/switches/{infraid} where: infraid is the database ID ( DB ID ) of the infrastructure. You can find the DB ID in IXP Manager in the infrastructures table (select Infrastructures from the left hand side menu). You can use skinning to make changes to the bundled default template or, preferably , add your own. Let's say you wanted to add your own template called myswtemplate1 and your skin is named myskin . The best way to proceed is to copy the bundled example: cd $IXPROOT mkdir -p resources/skins/myskin/api/v4/nagios/switches cp resources/views/api/v4/nagios/switches/default.foil.php resources/skins/myskin/api/v4/nagios/switches/myswtemplate1.foil.php You can then elect to use this template by tacking the name onto the API request: https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/nagios/switches/{infraid}/{template} where, in this example, {template} would be: myswtemplate1 . You can pass one optional parameter to Nagios via GET/POST which is the host definition to inherit from (see customer reachability testing about for full details and examples): curl --data \"host_definition=my-sw-host-def\" -X POST \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\ -H \"X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\" \\ https://ixpexample.com/api/v4/nagios/switches/2 Service Checking \uf0c1 The recommended way to check various services on your production switches is to use the host groups created by the above switch API call. An example of the hostgroups produced include: ixp-production-switches-infraid-2 : all switches on an infrastructure with DB ID 2; ixp-switches-infraid-2-dc-dub1 : all switches in location dc-dub1; ixp-switches-infraid-2-extreme : all Extreme switches on an infrastructure with DB ID 2; and ixp-switches-infraid-2-extreme-x670g2-48x-4q : all Extreme switches of model X670G2-48x-4q on an infrastructure with DB ID 2. Using these, you can create generic service definitions to apply to all hosts such as: define service{ use my-ixp-production-switch-service hostgroup_name ixp-production-switches-infraid-1, ixp-production-switches-infraid-2 service_description ping - IPv4 check_command check_ping_ipv4!10!100.0,10%!200.0,20% } define service { use my-ixp-production-switch-service hostgroup_name ixp-production-switches-infraid-1, ixp-production-switches-infraid-2 service_description SSH check_command check_ssh } You can target vendor / model specific checks as appropriate: define service{ use my-ixp-production-switch-service hostgroup_name ixp-switches-infraid-1-extreme, ixp-switches-infraid-2-extreme service_description Chassis check_command check_extreme_chassis } The one thing you'll need to keep an eye on is adding hostgroups to service checks as you create new infrastructures / add new switch vendors / models. Hint: over the years, we at INEX have written a number of switch chassis check scripts and these can be found on Github at barryo/nagios-plugins . For example the Extreme version checks and returns something like: OK - CPU: 5sec - 10%. Uptime: 62.8 days. PSUs: 1 - presentOK: 2 - presentOK:. Overall system power state: redundant power available. Fans: [101 - OK (4311 RPM)]: [102 - OK (9273 RPM)]: [103 - OK (4468 RPM)]: [104 - OK (9637 RPM)]: [105 - OK (4165 RPM)]: [106 - OK (9273 RPM)]:. Temp: 34'C. Memory (slot:usage%): 1:29%. Birdseye Daemon Monitoring \uf0c1 We monitor our Bird instances at INEX directly through Birdseye, the software we use for our looking glass . This means it is currently tightly coupled to Bird and Birdseye until such time as we look at a second router software. IXP Manager produces a host and service configuration for each router such as: define host { use ixp-manager-host-birdseye-daemon host_name bird-rc1q-cork-ipv4 alias INEX Cork - Quarantine Route Collector - IPv4 address 10.40.5.134 _apiurl http://rc1q-ipv4.cork.inex.ie/api } define service { use ixp-manager-service-birdseye-daemon host_name bird-rc1q-cork-ipv4 } You can use the IXP Manager API to get the Nagios configuration for all or a given VLAN using the following endpoint format (both GET and POST requests work): https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/nagios/birdseye-daemons https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/nagios/birdseye-daemons/{template} https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/nagios/birdseye-daemons/default/{vlanid} https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/nagios/birdseye-daemons/{template}/{vlanid} where: {template} is the optional skin (see below). {vlanid} is the VLAN id to limit the results to. If setting this, you need to provide a template also (or default for the standard template). You can use skinning to make changes to the bundled default template or, preferably , add your own. Let's say you wanted to add your own template called mybetemplate1 and your skin is named myskin . The best way to proceed is to copy the bundled example: cd $IXPROOT mkdir -p resources/skins/myskin/api/v4/nagios/birdseye-daemons cp resources/views/api/v4/nagios/birdseye-daemons/default.foil.php resources/skins/myskin/api/v4/nagios/birdseye-daemons/mybetemplate1.foil.php You can then elect to use this template by tacking the name onto the API request: https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/nagios/birdseye-daemons/{template} where, in this example, {template} would be: mybetemplate1 . You can pass two optional parameter to Nagios via GET/POST which is the host and service definition to inherit from (see customer reachability testing about for full details and examples): curl --data \"host_definition=my-be-host-def service_definition=my-be-srv-def\" -X POST \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\ -H \"X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\" \\ https://ixpexample.com/api/v4/nagios/birdseye-daemons The default values for the host and service definitions are ixp-manager-host-birdseye-daemon and ixp-manager-service-birdseye-daemon respectively. Service Checking \uf0c1 You will need to create a parent host and service definition for the generated configuration such as: define host { name ixp-manager-host-birdseye-daemon check_command check-host-alive check_period 24x7 max_check_attempts 10 notification_interval 120 notification_period 24x7 notification_options d,u,r contact_groups admins register 0 } define service { name ixp-manager-service-birdseye-daemon service_description Bird BGP Service check_command check_birdseye_daemon!$_HOSTAPIURL$ check_period 24x7 max_check_attempts 10 check_interval 5 retry_check_interval 1 contact_groups admins notification_interval 120 notification_period 24x7 notification_options w,u,c,r register 0 } define command{ command_name check_birdseye_daemon command_line /usr/local/nagios-plugins-other/nagios-check-birdseye.php -a $ARG1$ } The Nagios script we use is bundled with inex/birdseye and can be found here . Typical Nagios state output: OK: Bird 1.6.2. Bird's Eye 1.0.4. Router ID 192.0.2.126. Uptime: 235 days. Last Reconfigure: 2017-07-17 16:00:04.26 BGP sessions up of 28. Birdseye BGP Session Monitoring \uf0c1 We monitor our Bird route collector, route server and AS112 Bird BGP sessions at INEX directly through Birdseye, the software we use for our looking glass . This means it is currently tightly coupled to Bird and Birdseye until such time as we look at a second router software. IXP Manager produces a host and service configuration for each router type such as: ### Router: INEX LAN1 - Route Collector - IPv4 / 192.0.2.126. define service { use ixp-manager-member-bgp-session-service host_name as112-reverse-dns-as112-ipv4-vlanid2-vliid99 service_description BGP session to rc1-lan1-ipv4 (INEX LAN1 - Route Collector - IPv4) _api_url http://www.example.com/api _protocol pb_0099_as112 } The configuration also includes hostgroups for the given VLAN, protocol and type for: per-router; all sessions. You can use the IXP Manager API to get the Nagios configuration for a given protocol, VLAN and router type using the following templates: https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/nagios/birdseye-bgp-sessions/{vlanid}/{protocol}/{type} https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/nagios/birdseye-bgp-sessions/{vlanid}/{protocol}/{type}/{template} where: {vlanid} is the VLAN id to generate the configuration for. {protocol} is either 4 (ipv4) or 6 (ipv6). {type} is one of (these are defined in Entities\\Router ): 1 for route servers; 2 for route collectors; 3 for AS112 You can use skinning to make changes to the bundled default template or, preferably , add your own.

We have approached the issue a number of times in IXP Manger but abandoned the attempt every time. Typically our original solutions were over-engineered where all we really needed was something which could replace a spreadsheet per panel. We believe we have now developed a feature complete and useful means of managing patch panels and associated cross connects. Features \uf0c1 Add / edit patch panels (which includes cable and connector types). List associated patch panel ports which includes: their state (such as available / prewired, awaiting cross connect, connected, awaiting cease, reserved, broken). associated customer and/or switchport. co-location provider's circuit reference. internal ticket references. Transition ports from available / prewired to awaiting x-connect to connected to awaiting cease to ceased and then available again. Customer view of their cross connects. Public (visible to customers) and private notes per cross connect. Attach public and private files to cross connects (such as test results, completion documents, order forms, etc). Maintain complete history of a patch panel port. Generate and email LoAs (as PDF) with a URL verification function for co-location providers. Generate emails for connection and cease requests as well as an email providing full customer view of a cross connect. Typically fibre ports are duplex ports but there is a growing use of BiDi optics meaning simplex ports. Our implementation treats all ports as simplex but you can mark it as duplex and set its partner port. Duplex Fibre Ports \uf0c1 We suggest adding fibre ports as two ports per duplex port. I.e. if your patch panel has 12 duplex ports, enter this as 24 ports. When allocating ports later, you can set it as a duplex port and select its partner / slave port . This will future proof your patch panels for the growing use of bidi optics and other simplex based xWDM fibre solutions. From our experience, duplex fibre ports are often identified as their individual strands. For example, duplex port 5 would be referenced as F9/F10 . Your mileage may vary on this but we need to allow this flexibility to cover both use-cases. You always have options however: you can change the presentation of how these ports are referenced externally by skinning the templates. you have the option to edit emails before they are sent to also present this as you wish. you can chose to treat duplex ports as single ports rather than doubling them up. when you have duplex ports on a patch panel, IXP Manager will provide a duplex view by default with a CSS-based toggle to reveal the typical partner ports. if you think IXP Manager can make this easier, please talk to us. But we cannot cover every use case programatically. We've opted to allow flexibility rather than dictate a particular format. Adding a Patch Panel \uf0c1 The following image shows a typical add a new patch panel form (as of v4.3). You'll note that clicking Help provides detailed context aware help messages. Most of this is self-explanatory but: By default, we set the Colocation Reference to the Patch Panel Name . We are not sure it's a good idea for IXPs to create a second name different to the co-location provider's but this option is available to you. Seriously, think about what you are doing here - more references means more confusion! The cabinet and cable type is displayed in the list of patch panels so even with obscure data centre references, it should be easy to find what you need. Location Notes : Data centre / co-location providers do a lot of weird, wonderful and strange things! They provide multiple references for a single patch panel (IXP cabinet, MMR, etc.), they get taken over and re-reference everything or even provide no discernable reference. The field is a freetext field that will be included (and parsed as Markdown) in all emails generated by IXP Manager to help you help them identify a patch panel! In addition to that, we will also use a cabinets U's are counted from top/bottom , and a patch panel's U position and mounted at front/rear to also create a location description. * When setting the Number of Ports , ensure you count duplex fibre ports as two ports . So 12 duplex fibre ports would be entered as 24. When editing a patch panel, this input field represents the number of additional ports you want to add to a patch panel and thus defaults to 0 in that situation. * Port Name Prefix : This is an optional field intended for use on fibre patch panels. As an example, you may wish to prefix individual fibre strands in a duplex port with F which would mean the name of a duplex port would be displayed as F1/F2. * Chargeable : Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. Setting this only sets the default option when allocating ports to members later. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other. Filtering Patch Panel Ports \uf0c1 Quite often, all you are looking for is a free in a particular location (data centre) or cabinet of a particular cable type (UTP / SMF / etc.). IXP Manager makes this easy from the Patch Panels page via the top right button labeled Filter Options . When clicked, this yields an advanced search as follows: Cabinets auto-fills when you chose (or change) a location. Patch Panel Port States \uf0c1 A patch panel port can have the following states: Available : The port is free and available for use. Prewired : This is equivalent to available but it means the port is prewired to a given switchport (you set the port when setting the prewired status). This is useful for IXPs that prewire a bunch of ports to avoid remote hands costs / data centre visits. Awaiting Xconnect : Port has been assigned to a member and we are awaiting the co-location provider to install the cross connect. In this state, context aware actions such as emailing connection requests, LoA generation and Set Connected are all available. Connected : Connected and in use. Awaiting Cease : This connection is no longer required and we are awaiting the end user / co-location provider to cease the connection. Ceased : You will never see a ceased state. When a cross connect is marked as ceased, it's current state is archived (for history, include files) and the port is reset to Available . We do not revert to Prewired but an information message is shown to the user to hint this. Reserved : Useful to mark particular ports as off limits for whatever reason. Broken Other Free / Available Ports \uf0c1 IXP Manager will colour ports in the Available , Prewired and Awaiting Cease states are green allowing an easy visual indication of available ports. Patch Panel Port Lifecycle \uf0c1 Patch panel ports start as either available or prewired . The context menu in these states is: Unset Prewired is available as this port has a Prewired status. Clicking this reverts it to plain Available and disassociates it from the prewired port. Edit Note... is always available and provides a pop up to edit public and private notes associated with the port (current lifecycle - ceased ports have their notes at that time archived and cleared). The main lifecycle option here is Allocate : Description : A one line short description to be shown in the list of patch panel ports. Just enough to help explain the ports purpose. Detailed information should be placed in the notes section. Can also be used to explain a reserved / broken / other port. Note that this is parsed as Markdown. NB: A description is discouraged for customer ports connected to a switch. The customer name and switch port are the description. Colocation Circuit Reference : this is the reference provided by the colocation provider to uniquely reference this cross connect. Ticket Reference(s) : This is a free text field to be used by IXPs as they wish. The intended use is to enter helpdesk ticket references that relate to this cross connect order. Duplex connection? : Clicking this allows you to select the slave port for duplex connections. Switch / Switch Port / Customer : You have a number of options when allocating a port: If the port is pre-wired then the switch / switch port will be set here. If you chose a switch port which has been allocated to a customer, then this patch panel port will also be allocated to that customer. The backend logic will detect if this is the case and update the customer field. Conversely, if you chose a customer first, the switch / switch port dropdowns will be populated with only that customer's assigned ports. Sometimes you will get cross connects that are not intended to be connected to peering switches (e.g. connections to co-located customer equipment, IXP metro connections, etc.). In these cases, just select the customer (and if it's the IXP itself, select the IXP customer) and leave switch / switch port unselected. If you need to reset these fields, just click either of the Reset button. Patch Panel Port Status : when allocating a port, this will allow you to set the state to Awaiting Xconnect or Connected . Physical Interface Status : this is not depicted above. If the selected switch port has already been assigned to a customer by way of a physical interface, you will have the option to update this here also. Public and Private Notes : Public notes are available to the customer. Both fields are interpreted as Markdown. Chargeable : Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other. How individual IXPs use this is up to them. Internal Use : Marks the port as used by the IXP itself. E.g. metro connections. Owned By : Useful indication for billing and cease requests. Should represent the contractural owner of the cross connect. One of: Customer, IXP, Service Provider, Data Centre, Other. Service Provider might be a metro provider where they ordered the cross connect. Once a port is allocated, it enters the Awaiting XConnect / Connected state and there are additional context menu options available: The three lifecycle actions are: Set Connected : updates the status (and allows you to add public/private notes). You next action after this should be Email - Connect . Set Awaiting Cease : mark the port and pending disconnection. Your next action after this should be Email - Cease . Set Ceased : this is a transitive state in that it doesn't stick . When you mark a patch panel as ceased, the existing details (including files and notes) are archived as part of the port's history and then port is then cleared and made available again. File Attachments \uf0c1 Over the lifetime of a cross connect - and particularly when it is being ordered, there may be files exchanges between you and your customers or the colocation provider. These can be added to the patch panel port via the Attach File... option. The dialog will dynamically determine the maximum file upload size based on your PHP settings. To alter this, change the following in your server's appropriate php.ini : ; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files. upload_max_filesize = 40M ; Must be greater than or equal to upload_max_filesize post_max_size = 40M Please search the internet for further help as this is outside the scope of IXP Manager documentation. The following features apply to file attachments: they are archived along with the port history when a cross connect is ceased. they are stored under $IXPROOT/storage/files/ppp . two files of the same name cannot be uploaded for a single patch panel port. they can be marked as public or private: public files are accessible to the customer through their own dashboard. public files are attached to the Email - Information email. LoA Generation \uf0c1 Many co-location providers will not accept a cross connect order without a LoA (Letter of Agency/Authority) from the party to whom the cross connect is to be delivered (typically the IXP). IXP Manager will generate a PDF LoA to download or include in the emails it generates for you. Here is an example: You will need to skin this yourself to change the legalese, address and contact details and potentially add a logo. See the version INEX uses here (which includes and embedded PNG logo). Note that Dompdf is used to turn the HTML template into a PDF and it has some restrictions. You have two options for generating LoAs (without having IXP Manager email them): Download PDF : downloads the PDF via your browser. View PDF : displays the PDF LoA in your browser (where browser supports it). LoA Verification \uf0c1 The stock LoA template (and INEX's version) includes a link that allows co-location browsers to click on to verify its veracity. On successful verification, the end user sees: Email Generation \uf0c1 IXP Manager allows you to send four emails related to patch panels / cross connects (port status dependent). These are listed below. The Email editor looks as follows: Note that: the option to attach a PDF LoA is a checkbox. the email is written in Markdown with a preview available. The email is sent as both HTML (from the Markdown) and the plaintext version. The four email templates available are: Email - Connect : Email the customer a request to order a cross connect to the given demarcation points. A LoA is attached as a PDF by default unless you uncheck the box in the email editor. Email - Cease : Email the customer a request to cease a cross connect. Email - Information : Email the customer all details on file about a cross connect. We often get requests for this at INEX and this simplifies the process. The generated email includes: the standard details regarding port and co-location reference; public notes; public files as attachments. Email - LoA : Email a LoA to the customer as attached as a PDF. This is similar to Email - Connect but it is more reflective of a typical response to a second request for a LoA. All email templates can be skinned for your own needs. See INEX's example skins here .

The main lifecycle option here is Allocate : Description : A one line short description to be shown in the list of patch panel ports. Just enough to help explain the ports purpose. Detailed information should be placed in the notes section. Can also be used to explain a reserved / broken / other port. Note that this is parsed as Markdown. NB: A description is discouraged for customer ports connected to a switch. The customer name and switch port are the description. Colocation Circuit Reference : this is the reference provided by the colocation provider to uniquely reference this cross connect. Ticket Reference(s) : This is a free text field to be used by IXPs as they wish. The intended use is to enter helpdesk ticket references that relate to this cross connect order. Duplex connection? : Clicking this allows you to select the slave port for duplex connections. Switch / Switch Port / Customer : You have a number of options when allocating a port: If the port is pre-wired then the switch / switch port will be set here. If you chose a switch port which has been allocated to a customer, then this patch panel port will also be allocated to that customer. The backend logic will detect if this is the case and update the customer field. Conversely, if you chose a customer first, the switch / switch port dropdowns will be populated with only that customer's assigned ports. Sometimes you will get cross connects that are not intended to be connected to peering switches (e.g. connections to co-located customer equipment, IXP metro connections, etc.). In these cases, just select the customer (and if it's the IXP itself, select the IXP customer) and leave switch / switch port unselected. If you need to reset these fields, just click either of the Reset button. Patch Panel Port Status : when allocating a port, this will allow you to set the state to Awaiting Xconnect or Connected . Physical Interface Status : this is not depicted above. If the selected switch port has already been assigned to a customer by way of a physical interface, you will have the option to update this here also. Public and Private Notes : Public notes are available to the customer. Both fields are interpreted as Markdown. Chargeable : Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other. How individual IXPs use this is up to them. Internal Use : Marks the port as used by the IXP itself. E.g. metro connections. Owned By : Useful indication for billing and cease requests. Should represent the contractural owner of the cross connect. One of: Customer, IXP, Service Provider, Data Centre, Other. Service Provider might be a metro provider where they ordered the cross connect. Once a port is allocated, it enters the Awaiting XConnect / Connected state and there are additional context menu options available: The three lifecycle actions are: Set Connected : updates the status (and allows you to add public/private notes). You next action after this should be Email - Connect . Set Awaiting Cease : mark the port and pending disconnection. Your next action after this should be Email - Cease . Set Ceased : this is a transitive state in that it doesn't stick . When you mark a patch panel as ceased, the existing details (including files and notes) are archived as part of the port's history and then port is then cleared and made available again.","title":"Patch Panel Port Lifecycle"},{"location":"features/patch-panels/#file-attachments","text":"Over the lifetime of a cross connect - and particularly when it is being ordered, there may be files exchanges between you and your customers or the colocation provider.

To alter this, change the following in your server's appropriate php.ini : ; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files. upload_max_filesize = 40M ; Must be greater than or equal to upload_max_filesize post_max_size = 40M Please search the internet for further help as this is outside the scope of IXP Manager documentation.

There are two primary data sources: route server clients and sflow. Currently, it is assumed that all IXP participants who connect to the route server have an open peering policy and do not filter prefixes. NB: You must check the Peering Matrix option when editing VLANs for that VLAN to be included in the peering matrix on the frontend. Data Source: Route Server Clients \uf0c1 Route server clients are automatically shown as peering with each other onm the peering matrix. No operator input is required for this. Data Source: sflow BGP session detection \uf0c1 IXP Manager can pick out active BGP sessions from an sflow data feed. This is handled using the sflow-detect-ixp-bgp-sessions script. As this is a perl script, it is necessary to install all the perl modules listed in the check-perl-dependencies.pl script. Sflow is a packet sampling mechanism, which means that it will take some while before the peering database is populated. After 24 hours of operation, the peering database should be relatively complete. sflow-detect-ixp-bgp-sessions needs its own dedicated sflow data feed, so it is necessary to set up sflow data fan-out using the sflowtool as described in the sflow fan-out section here . INEX normally uses udp port 5501 for its bgp detection sflow feed. For more information, see the sflow documentation . Configuring ixpmanager.conf \uf0c1 In addition to the correct SQL configuration for the sql section, sflow-detect-ixp-bgp-sessions needs the following options set in the ixp section of ixpmanager.conf : sflowtool : the location of the sflowtool binary. sflowtool_bgp_opts : command line arguments for sflowtool .

If it starts up correctly, the script should occasionally print out peering sessions like this: DEBUG: [2001:db8::ff]:64979 - [2001:db8::7]:179 tcpflags 000010000: ack. database updated.

Running the daemon in production \uf0c1 The script control-sflow-detect-ixp-bgp-sessions should be copied (and edited if necessary) to the operating system startup directory so that sflow-detect-ixp-bgp-sessions is started as a normal daemon. Controlling Access to the Peering Matrix \uf0c1 The peering matrix is publically available by default. However you can limit access to a minimum user privilege by setting PEERING_MATRIX_MIN_AUTH to an integer from 0 to 3 in your .env . See here for what these integers mean .

Under normal circumstances, this will be very noisy.

You / we would still have a relationship with the member independent of the reseller and would still be required to carry out the standard turn up (for us, this includes IP assignment, quarantine procedures, route collector session, route server sessions if appropriate, etc.). IXP Manager's functionality is simply to: record that a reseller relationship exists allow you to manage reseller and fanout ports Features \uf0c1 A customer / member can now also be a reseller. If you have a non-customer reseller, create them as an associate or internal member as appropriate. This is a boolean switch available in the add / edit customer page. Any customer can be marked as a resold customer of a named reseller . This is set in the add / edit customer page. If a customer is a reseller or a resold customer, this is clearly visible in the customer overview page. A reseller cannot be demoted from reseller status while there are resold customers assigned to it. In the reseller customer overview page, there is a new tab listing all the customers they have resold to the IXP. In the reseller customer overview page, the ports are separated into reseller uplink ports, the reseller's own peering ports and the fanout ports used to deliver the reseller's customers' traffic. Reseller and Fanout Ports. \uf0c1 For resellers, we need to enforce the one port - one mac - one address rule on the peering LAN. Depending on switch technology, this can be done using a virtual ethernet port; or a dedicated fanout switch / port. Currently the schema cannot adequately handle a virtual ethernet port. Typically, we'd assign a dedicated switch (or bunch of switch ports) as a fanout switch with a reseller uplink port (or LAG). The reseller delivers their customer traffic in dedicated VLANs over this uplink port. We then break each individual customer's traffic into dedicated fanout ports . These physical fanout ports have a one to one relationship with peering ports for that customer (these can be single physical ports or LAGs).

Normally on a peering exchange, all connected parties will establish bilateral peering relationships with each other customer connected to the exchange. As the number of connected parties increases, it becomes increasingly more difficult to manage peering relationships with customers of the exchange. A typical peering exchange full-mesh eBGP configuration might look something similar to the diagram on the left hand side. The full-mesh BGP session relationship scenario requires that each BGP speaker configure and manage BGP sessions to every other BGP speaker on the exchange. In this example, a full-mesh setup requires 7 BGP sessions per member router, and this increases every time a new member connects to the exchange. However, by using a route servers for peering relationships, the number of BGP sessions per router stays at two: one for each route server (assuming a resilient set up). Clearly this is a more sustainable way of maintaining IXP peering relationships with a large number of participants. Configuration Generation Features \uf0c1 Please review the generic router documentation to learn how to automatically generate route server configurations. This section goes into a bit more specific detail on INEX's route server configuration (as shipped with IXP Manager) and why it's safe to use. You should also look at the following resources: watch the IXP Manager Update Route Server Configuration presentation from the 32nd Euro-IX Forum held in Galway, Ireland, April 2018: [ pdf ] [ video ]. to fully understand RPKI with IXP Manager, watch our presentation from APRICOT 2019. read this article on INEX's website. The features of the route server configurations that IXP Manager generates include: RPKI support when using the Bird v2 templates; full prefix filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required) - see the IRRDB documentation here ; full origin ASN filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required); in all cases, prefix filtering for IPv4 and v6 based on the IANA special purpose registries (also known as bogon lists); ensuring next hop is the neighbor address to ensure no next hop hijacking; max prefix limits; multiple VLAN interfaces for a single member supported; large BGP communities supported; over a decade of production use and experience. With Bird v2 support in IXP Manager v5, we provide better looking glass integration and other tooling to show members which prefixes are filtered and why. The Bird v2 filtering mechanism is as follows: Filter small prefixes (default is /24 / /48 for ipv4 / ipv6). Filter martians / bogons prefixes ( see this template ). Sanity check - filter prefixes with no AS path or 64 ASNs in AS path. Sanity check to ensure peer AS is the same as first AS in the prefix\u2019s AS path. Prevent next-hop hijacking. This occurs when a participant advertises a prefix with a next hop IP other than their own. An exception exists to allow participants with multiple connections advertise their other router (next-hop within the same AS). Filter known transit networks - see FIXME IRRDB filtering: ensure origin AS is in set of ASNs from member AS-SET. RPKI: Valid - accept Invalid - drop RPKI Unknown - revert to standard IRRDB prefix filtering. Setting Up \uf0c1 You first need to add your route servers to the IXP Manager routers database. See this page on how to do that . Typically an IXP's route server service will have a dedicated ASN that is different to the IXP's own management / route collector ASN. As such, you need to add a new internal customer to IXP Manager. You are strongly advised to use / request a 16-bit ASN from your RIR for route server use. If you do not, you will be unable to offer your members standard community based filtering. Here's an example from INEX for our route server #1 : You then need to create an interface for this route server on each peering LAN where the service will be offered. Here again is INEX's example from our peering LAN1 in Dublin: There's a couple things to note in the above: AS112 Client is checked which means (so long as Route Server Client is checked on the AS112 service ) the AS112 service will peer with the route servers. Apply IRRDB Filtering has no meaning here as this is the route server rather than the route server client. Per ASN Import / Export Filters \uf0c1 There are occasions where you may need to override the default filtering mechanism for some members. IXP Manager allows you to create custom Bird2 checks at the start of the standard import / export filters when using Bird2 (not supported on the older Bird v1 configuration). To do this, you must create skinned files named after the ASN. For example, let's assume your skin name is example and the ASN of the member you want to apply custom filtering to is 65500 ; then you would an export and/or import filter in files named: $IXPROOT/resources/skins/example/api/v4/router/server/bird2/f_import_as65500.foil.php $IXPROOT/resources/skins/example/api/v4/router/server/bird2/f_export_as65500.foil.php You'll see real examples from INEX here . Remember that these are placed at the beginning of the standard filters allowing you to explicitly accept or reject the prefix. However, remember that INEX accepts prefixes on import always but tags prefixes for filtering with large community routerasn:1101:x - please see the resources referenced above for details on this. Displaying Filtered Prefixes \uf0c1 Using Bird v2 and internal large communities, we have completely overhauled how we show end users what prefixes are filtered by the route servers. If you are running route servers using the Bird v2 configuration and if you have installed the looking glass then you should set the following in your .env file: IXP_FE_FRONTEND_DISABLED_FILTERED_PREFIXES=false This is a live view gathered from each Bird v2 route server with a looking glass. Legacy Prefix Analysis Tool \uf0c1 The older but deprecated means of viewing filtered prefixes was the Route Server Prefix Analysis tool which allows your members to examine what routes they are advertising to the route servers, which are being accepted and which are being rejected. Limits / Caveats \uf0c1 Implemented as a Perl script which accesses the database directly. The script can also only be used on one LAN and one route server. Thus, pick you most popular LAN and route server. Setting Up \uf0c1 Download this script to your route server; Ensure you install and configure the IXP Manager Perl library on this route server also; Edit the compare-route-server-prefixes.pl script and set the Bird configuration file and socket (you can find the position in the file by searching for XXX-SET-ME ); See also this diff for further hints; Execute the compare-route-server-prefixes.pl script a few times a day as you think appropriate; In your .env file, ensure the following is set: IXP_FE_FRONTEND_DISABLED_RS_PREFIXES=false Once you make the last change above, the prefix analysis tool will be available to administrators and members on IXP Manager.","title":"Route Servers"},{"location":"features/route-servers/#route-servers","text":"Prerequisite Reading: Ensure you first familiarize yourself with the generic documentation on managing and generating router configurations here .

See the above pages for specific information on each of those use cases and below for instructions on how to generate configuration. Managing Routers \uf0c1 The basic elements of a router are configured in IXP Manager under the IXP Admin Actions - Routers option on the left hand menu. When you goto add / edit a router, the green help button will provide explanatory details on each field of information required: From the router management page, you can: add / edit / delete a router; view all the details of a router; generate and view a router's configuration. Configuration Generation Overview \uf0c1 The simplest configuration to generate is the route collector configuration. A route collector is an IXP router which serves only to accept all routes and export no routes . It is used for problem diagnosis, to aid customer monitoring and for looking glasses (see INEX's here ). The original Bird v1 configuration simply pulls in a fairly standard header (sets up router ID, listening address and some filters) and creates a session for all customer routers on the given VLAN. The new Bird v2 configuration has more features and replicates the route server filtering mechanism but tags and accepts all routes for diagnosis. When adding a router, you give it a handle . For example: rc1-lan1-ipv4 which, for INEX, would mean a route collector on peering LAN1 using IPv4. Then - for the given router handle - the configuration can be generated and pulled using the API as follows: #! /bin/sh # The API Key. # This is generated in IXP Manager via the top right menu: *My Account - API Keys* KEY=\"your-admin-ixp-manager-api-key\" # The base URL of your IXP Manager install plus: 'api/v4/router/gen-config' URL=\"https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/gen-config\" # The handle is as described above: HANDLE=\"rc1-lan1-ipv4\" # Then the configuration can be pulled as follows: curl --fail -s -H \"X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: ${KEY}\" ${URL}/${HANDLE} ${HANDLE}.conf Configurations for the route server and AS112 templates can be configured just as easily. The stock templates for both are secure and well tested and can be used by setting the template element of the router to one of the following. NB: from May 2019, we recommend you use IXP Manager v5 and Bird2 templates. AS112: 'api/v4/router/as112/bird/standard' 'api/v4/router/as112/bird2/standard' Route Collector: 'api/v4/router/collector/bird/standard' 'api/v4/router/collector/bird2/standard' Route Server: 'api/v4/router/server/bird/standard' 'api/v4/router/server/bird2/standard' We also provide sample scripts for automating the re-configuration of these services by cron: AS112 scripts can be found here . Route collector scripts can be found here . Route server scripts in this directory . These are quite robust and have been in production for ~5 years at INEX (as of Jan 2019). All of these scripts have been written defensively such that if there is any issue getting the configuring or validating the configuration then the running router instance should be unaffected. This has worked in practice at INEX when IXP Manager was under maintenance, when there were management connectivity issues and when there were database issues. They also use the updated API (see below) to mark when the router configuration update script ran successfully. Updated API \uf0c1 It can be useful to know that the scripts for updating the router configuration for AS112, route collector and route server BGP daemons run successfully. At INEX for example, we have three LANs and so 10 individual servers running a total of 30 Bird instances which is unwieldy to check and monitor manually. When viewing routers in IXP Manager, you may have noticed the Last Updated column which will initially show (unknown) . All our update scripts (see above) trigger the updated API call when a route configuration run has completed successfully. Note that this does not mean that a configuration has necessarily changed but rather that the update script ran and executed correctly. In other words: the configuration was successfully pulled from IXP Manager, compared to the running configuration and, if changed, successfully applied . The API call to update the last updated field to now is a POST as follows: curl -s -X POST -H \"X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\" \\ https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/updated/{handle} where {handle} should be replaced with the route handle as described above. The result is a JSON object with the datetime as set and is equivalent to the result of the following API call which fetchs the last updated field without setting it: curl -s -X GET -H \"X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\" \\ https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/updated/{handle} {\"last_updated\":\"2017-05-21T19:14:43+00:00\",\"last_updated_unix\":1495394083} There are two useful additional API endpoints. To get the last updated time of all routers, use: curl -s -X GET -H \"X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\" \\ https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/updated {\"handle1\":{\"last_updated\":\"2017-05-21T19:14:43+00:00\",\"last_updated_unix\":1495394083}, \"handle2\":{\"last_updated\":null,\"last_updated_unix\":null}, ...} The above output shows the format of the reply as well as the fact that routers without a last updated value set will be included as null values. Lastly, you can request the last updated time of routers where that time exceeds a given number of seconds. In this call, routers without a last updated time will not be returned. This is useful for monitoring applications such as Nagios where you would want a warning / alert on any routers that have not updated in the last day for example: curl -s -X GET -H \"X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\" \\ https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/updated-before/86400 [] This example also shows that an empty JSON object is returned for an empty result. Otherwise the format of the reply is the same as for the call above for all routers: {\"handle1\":{\"last_updated\":\"2017-05-21T19:14:43+00:00\",\"last_updated_unix\":1495394083},...} Examples \uf0c1 We use Travis CI to test IXP Manager before pushing new releases. The primary purpose of this is to ensure that the configuration for routers generated matches known good configurations from the same sample database. These known good configurations also serve as useful examples of what the standard IXP Manager configuration generates. See these known good configurations here and: as112 : AS112 router configurations conforming to rfc7534 (AS112 Nameserver Operations) and implementing rfc7535 (AS112 Redirection Using DNAME).

The best way to fully understand RPKI with IXP Manager is to watch our presentation from APRICOT 2019 or read this article on INEX's website. RPKI Validator / Local Cache \uf0c1 IXP Manager uses the RPKI-RTR protocol to feed ROAs to the Bird router instances. We recommend you install two of these validators/local caches from different vendors. Let IXP Manager know where they are by setting the following .env settings: # IP address and port of the first RPKI local cache: IXP_RPKI_RTR1_HOST=192.0.2.11 IXP_RPKI_RTR1_PORT=3323 # While not required, we recommend you also install a second validator: # IXP_RPKI_RTR2_HOST=192.0.2.12 # IXP_RPKI_RTR2_PORT=3323 INEX has installed three local caches. As of May 2019, we would recommend Cloudflare's RPKI Toolkit and NLnetLabs Routinator 3000. We had a number of issues with the current implementation of RIPE's version (excessive disk usage, regularly crashing). See our installation notes for these: Cloudflare's RPKI Toolkit . RIPE NCC RPKI Validator 3 . Routinator 3000 . Revalidation \uf0c1 As it stands, Bird v2.0.4 does not support revalidation of prefixes following ROA updates (i.e. a prefix that was accepted as ROA valid that subsequently becomes ROA unknown / invalid will remain learnt as ROA valid). The Bird developers are working on fixing this. In the interim, you need to schedule a revalidation via cron using a /etc/crontab entry such as: 20 11,23 * * * root /usr/sbin/birdc -s /var/run/bird/bird-rs1-ipv4.ctl reload in all /dev/null Enabling RPKI \uf0c1 The outline procedure to enable RPKI is below. These notes are written from the perspective that you have existing IXP Manager Bird v1 route servers. If this is a green field site, these notes will work just as well by ignoring the upgrade bits. In either case, it's vital you already understand how to configure routers in IXP Manager . At INEX we started with our route collector which is a non-service affecting administrative tool. Once we were happy with the stability and results of that, we upgraded our two route servers one week apart in planned announced maintenance windows. We also took the opportunity to perform a distribution upgrade from Ubuntu 16.04 to 18.04. Start by installing two local caches / validator services as linked above. INEX uses Cloudflare's and Routinator 3000. You should also add these to your production monitoring service. Once your maintenance window starts, stop the target route server you plan to upgrade. You'll then need to to remove the Bird v1 package ( dpkg -r bird on Ubuntu). Once the Bird package is removed, you can perform a distribution upgrade if you wish. At time of writing (May 2019), there are no Bird v2 packages for Debian or Ubuntu. As such, you need to install from source. Rather than installing a build environment and compiling on each server, you can do this on a single server (a dedicated build box / admin server / etc) and then distribute the package across your route servers / collector: # Install Ubuntu build packages and libraries Bird requires: apt install -y build-essential libssh-dev libreadline-dev \\ libncurses-dev flex bison checkinstall # At time of writing, the latest release was v2.0.4. # Check for newer versions! cd /usr/src wget ftp://bird.network.cz/pub/bird/bird-2.0.4.tar.gz tar zxf bird-2.0.4.tar.gz cd bird-2.0.4/ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc make -j2 checkinstall -y The checkinstall tool creates a deb package file: /usr/local/src/bird-2.0.4/bird_2.0.4-1_amd64.deb NB: for this method to work, you must be running the same operating system and version on the target servers as the build box. For us, it was Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on all systems. To install on a target machine: # from build machine scp bird_2.0.4-1_amd64.deb target-machine:/tmp # on target machine apt install -y libssh-dev libreadline-dev libncurses-dev dpkg -i /tmp/bird_2.0.4-1_amd64.deb You now need to update your route server record in IXP Manager: set Software to Bird v2 (this is currently informational only); check Enable RPKI filtering ; update the template to api/v4/router/server/bird2/standard . Note that the Bird v2 template uses large BGP communities extensively internally. The option Enable Large BGP Communities / RFC8092 only controls whether your members can use large communities for filtering. It's 2019 - you should really enable this. As mentioned above, you need to let IXP Manager know where your local caching / validators are by setting the following .env settings: # IP address and port of the first RPKI local cache: IXP_RPKI_RTR1_HOST=192.0.2.11 IXP_RPKI_RTR1_PORT=3323 # While not required, we recommend you also install a second validator: IXP_RPKI_RTR2_HOST=192.0.2.12 IXP_RPKI_RTR2_PORT=3323 Take a look at the generated configuration within IXP Manager now and sanity check it. If you have been using our scripts to reload route server configurations, you will need to download the new one (and edit the lines at the top) or update your existing one. The main elements that need to be changed is that the daemon name is not longer named differently for IPv6 (Bird v1 had bird/birdc and bird6/bird6c where as Bird v2 only has bird/birdc ). You should now be able to run this script to pull a new configuration and start an instance of the route server. We would start with one and compare route numbers (just eyeball them) against the route server you have not upgraded. You're nearly there! If you are using our Bird's Eye looking glass , you will need to upgrade this to = v1.2.1 for Bird v2 support. At INEX, we tend to clone the repository and so a simple git pull is all that's required. If you're installing from release packages, get the latest one and copy over your configurations.

We also took the opportunity to perform a distribution upgrade from Ubuntu 16.04 to 18.04. Start by installing two local caches / validator services as linked above. INEX uses Cloudflare's and Routinator 3000. You should also add these to your production monitoring service. Once your maintenance window starts, stop the target route server you plan to upgrade. You'll then need to to remove the Bird v1 package ( dpkg -r bird on Ubuntu). Once the Bird package is removed, you can perform a distribution upgrade if you wish. At time of writing (May 2019), there are no Bird v2 packages for Debian or Ubuntu. As such, you need to install from source. Rather than installing a build environment and compiling on each server, you can do this on a single server (a dedicated build box / admin server / etc) and then distribute the package across your route servers / collector: # Install Ubuntu build packages and libraries Bird requires: apt install -y build-essential libssh-dev libreadline-dev \\ libncurses-dev flex bison checkinstall # At time of writing, the latest release was v2.0.4. # Check for newer versions! cd /usr/src wget ftp://bird.network.cz/pub/bird/bird-2.0.4.tar.gz tar zxf bird-2.0.4.tar.gz cd bird-2.0.4/ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc make -j2 checkinstall -y The checkinstall tool creates a deb package file: /usr/local/src/bird-2.0.4/bird_2.0.4-1_amd64.deb NB: for this method to work, you must be running the same operating system and version on the target servers as the build box. For us, it was Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on all systems. To install on a target machine: # from build machine scp bird_2.0.4-1_amd64.deb target-machine:/tmp # on target machine apt install -y libssh-dev libreadline-dev libncurses-dev dpkg -i /tmp/bird_2.0.4-1_amd64.deb You now need to update your route server record in IXP Manager: set Software to Bird v2 (this is currently informational only); check Enable RPKI filtering ; update the template to api/v4/router/server/bird2/standard . Note that the Bird v2 template uses large BGP communities extensively internally. The option Enable Large BGP Communities / RFC8092 only controls whether your members can use large communities for filtering. It's 2019 - you should really enable this. As mentioned above, you need to let IXP Manager know where your local caching / validators are by setting the following .env settings: # IP address and port of the first RPKI local cache: IXP_RPKI_RTR1_HOST=192.0.2.11 IXP_RPKI_RTR1_PORT=3323 # While not required, we recommend you also install a second validator: IXP_RPKI_RTR2_HOST=192.0.2.12 IXP_RPKI_RTR2_PORT=3323 Take a look at the generated configuration within IXP Manager now and sanity check it. If you have been using our scripts to reload route server configurations, you will need to download the new one (and edit the lines at the top) or update your existing one. The main elements that need to be changed is that the daemon name is not longer named differently for IPv6 (Bird v1 had bird/birdc and bird6/bird6c where as Bird v2 only has bird/birdc ). You should now be able to run this script to pull a new configuration and start an instance of the route server. We would start with one and compare route numbers (just eyeball them) against the route server you have not upgraded. You're nearly there! If you are using our Bird's Eye looking glass , you will need to upgrade this to = v1.2.1 for Bird v2 support. At INEX, we tend to clone the repository and so a simple git pull is all that's required. If you're installing from release packages, get the latest one and copy over your configurations.","title":"Enabling RPKI"},{"location":"features/rpki/#bird-operational-notes","text":"These notes are valid when using IXP Manager's Bird v2 with RPKI route server configuration.

Before proceeding further, this should be configured so that when you click on either the MAC Addresses | Discovered Addresses or MAC Addresses | Configured Addresses links from the admin portal, you should see a MAC address associated with each port. If you cannot see any MAC address in either database, then the sflow peer-to-peer graphing mechanism will not work. This needs to be working properly before any attempt is made to configure sflow peer-to-peer graphing. The sflow p2p graphing system can use either discovered MAC addresses or configured MAC addresses, but not both. Server Overview \uf0c1 As sflow can put a reasonably high load on a server due to disk I/O for RRD file updates - it is recommended practice to use a separate server (or virtual server) to handle the IXP's sflow system. The sflow server will need: Apache (or any other web server) sflowtool git rrdtool + rrdcached perl 5.10.2 or later mrtg (for Net_SNMP_util) a filesystem partition mounted with the noatime , nodiratime options, and which has enough disk space. You may also want to consider disabling filesystem journaling. Configuration \uf0c1 FreeBSD \uf0c1 pkg install apache24 sflowtool git databases/rrdtool mrtg Ubuntu \uf0c1 apt-get install apache2 git rrdtool rrdcached mrtg sflowtool is not part of the Ubuntu / Debian package archive and must be compiled from source if running on these systems. The source code can be found on Github: https://github.com/sflow/sflowtool. Once the required packages are installed, the IXP Manager peer-to-peer graphing system can be configured as follows: Clone the IXP Manager installation using git clone https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager /srv/ixpmanager . Check what perl libraries need to be installed using the tools/runtime/check-perl-dependencies.pl command. These libraries will need to be manually installed. Install the IXP Manager perl library in the tools/perl-lib/IXPManager directory ( perl Makefile.PL; make install ) configure and start rrdcached . We recommend using journaled mode with the -P FLUSH,UPDATE -m 0666 -l unix:/var/run/rrdcached.sock options enabled. Note that these options allow uncontrolled write access to the RRD files from anyone on the sflow machine, so precautions should be taken to limit access to this server to ensure that this cannot be abused. On FreeBSD it is advisable to set net.inet.udp.blackhole=1 in /etc/sysctl.conf , to stop the kernel from replying to unknown sflow packets with an ICMP unreachable reply. ixpmanager.conf \uf0c1 The following sflow parameters must be set in the ixp section: sflow_rrdcached : set to 0 or 1, depending on whether you want to use rrdcached or not. sflowtool : the location of the sflowtool binary. sflowtool_opts : command-line options to pass to sflowtool sflow_rrddir : the directory where all the sflow .rrd files will be stored. apikey : a valid API key. Instructions for configuring this can be found in the API configuration documentation. apibaseurl : the base URL of the IXP Manager API. E.g. if you log into IXP Manager using http://www.example.com/ixp/ , then apibaseurl will be http://www.example.com/ixp/api/v4 . macdbtype : configured|discovered - specifies whether the sflow p2p graphing system should pull MAC address information from the Configured MAC address database or the Discovered MAC address database. By default, it uses the Discovered MAC address database. If you wish to use the Configured MAC address database, then this should be set to configured . Note that the sql section of ixpmanager.conf will need to be configured either if you are running update-l2database.pl or the sflow BGP peering matrix system on the same server as the p2p sflow system. An example ixpmanager.conf might look like this: sql dbase_type = mysql dbase_database = ixpmanager dbase_username = ixpmanager_user dbase_password = blahblah dbase_hostname = sql.example.com /sql ixp sflowtool = /usr/bin/sflowtool sflowtool_opts = -4 -p 6343 -l sflow_rrdcached = 1 sflow_rrddir = /data/ixpmatrix apikey = APIKeyFromIXPManager apibaseurl = http://www.example.com/ixp/api/v4 macdbtype = configured /ixp This file should be placed in /usr/local/etc/ixpmanager.conf Starting sflow-to-rrd-handler \uf0c1 The tools/runtime/sflow/sflow-to-rrd-handler command processes the output from sflowtool and injects it into the RRD archive. This command should be configured to start on system bootup. If you are running on FreeBSD, this command can be started on system bootup by copying the tools/runtime/sflow/sflow_rrd_handler script into /usr/local/etc/rc.d and modifying the /etc/rc.conf command to include: sflow_bgp_handler_enable=\"YES\" Displaying the Graphs \uf0c1 The IXP Manager web GUI requires access to the sflow p2p .rrd files over http or https. This means that the sflow server must run a web server (e.g. Apache), and the IXP Manager GUI must be configured with the URL of the RRD archive on the sflow server. Assuming that ixpmanager.conf is configured to use /data/ixpmatrix for the RRD directory, these files can be server over HTTP using the following Apache configuration: Alias /grapher-sflow /data/ixpmatrix Directory \"/data/ixpmatrix\" Options None AllowOverride None /Directory The IXP Manager .env file must be configured with parameters both to enable sflow and to provide the front-end with the HTTP URL of the back-end server. Assuming that the sflow p2p server has IP address 10.0.0.1, then the following lines should be added to .env : GRAPHER_BACKENDS=\"mrtg|sflow|smokeping\" GRAPHER_BACKEND_SFLOW_ENABLED=true GRAPHER_BACKEND_SFLOW_ROOT=\"http://10.0.0.1/grapher-sflow\" RRD Requirements \uf0c1 Each IXP edge port will have 4 separate RRD files for recording traffic to each other participant on the same VLAN on the IXP fabric: ipv4 bytes, ipv6 bytes, ipv4 packets and ipv6 packets. This means that the number of RRD files grows very quickly as the number of IXP participants increases. Roughly speaking, for every N participants at the IXP, there will be about 4*N^2 RRD files. As this number can create extremely high I/O requirements on even medium sized exchanges, IXP Manager requires that rrdcached is used. Troubleshooting \uf0c1 There are plenty of things which could go wrong in a way which would stop the sflow mechanism from working properly. the Mac Address table in IXP manager is populated correctly with all customer MAC addresses using the update-l2database.pl script, if you are using discovered MAC addresses. If you're using configured MAC addresses, you can ignore update-l2database.pl script completed but you should make sure that there are valid MAC addresses associated with each port you're attempting to monitor. ensuring that all switch ports are set up correctly in IXP Manager, i.e. Core ports and Peering ports are configured as such ensuring that sflow accounting is configured on peering ports and is disabled on all core ports ensuring that sflow accounting is as ingress-only Using Arista / Cisco / Dell F10 kit with LAGs? Make sure you configure the port channel name in the Advanced Options section of the customer's virtual interface port configuration. if the sflow-to-rrd-handler script crashes, this may indicate that the back-end filesystem is overloaded. Installing rrdcached is a first step here. If it crashes with rrdcached enabled, then you need more disk I/O (SSDs, etc). it is normal to see about 5% difference between sflow stats and mrtg stats. These differences are hardware and software implementation dependent. Every switch manufacturer does things slightly differently. if there is too much of a difference between the sflow p2p individual aggregate stats and the port stats from the main graphing system, it might be that the switch is throttling sflow samples. It will be necessary to check the maximum sflow pps rate on the switch processor, compare that with the pps rate in the Switch Statistics graphs and work out the switch process pps throughput on the basis of the sflow sample rate. Increasing the sflow sampling ration may help, at the cost of less accurate graphs for peering sessions with low traffic levels. FreeBSD, really? \uf0c1 No. All of this runs perfectly well on Ubuntu (or your favourite Linux distribution). INEX runs its sflow back-end on FreeBSD because we found that the UFS filesystem performs better than the Linux ext3 filesystem when handling large RRD archives. If you run rrdcached , it's unlikely that you will run into performance problems. If you do, you can engineer around them by running the RRD archive on a PCIe SSD.","title":"Peer-to-peer Graphs"},{"location":"features/sflow-p2p/#configuring-peer-to-peer-statistics","text":"The IXP Manager sflow peer-to-peer graphing system depends on the MAC address database system so that point to point traffic flows can be identified.

Helicopter View \uf0c1 Sflow needs to be configured with an \"accounting perimeter\". This means that ingress sflow accounting should be enabled on all edge ports, but should not be enabled on any of the core ports. This approach ensures that all packets entering or leaving the IXP are counted exactly once, when they enter the IXP fabric. All the switches at the IXP should be configured to send sflow packets to the IP address of your sflow collector. This will probably be the same server that you use for your IXP Manager sflow peer-to-peer graphing. If sflow is enabled on any of the core ports or sflow is enabled in both directions (ingress + egress), traffic will be double-counted and this will lead to incorrect graphs. Each switch on the network sends sampled sflow packets to an sflow collector. These packets are processed by the \"sflowtool\" command, which converts into an easily-parseable ascii format. IXP Manager provides a script to read the output of the sflowtool command, correlate this against the IXP database and to use this to build up a matrix of traffic flows which are then exported to an RRD database. The RRD files are stored on disk and can be accessed by using the sflow graphing system included in IXP Manager. Sflow on Switches \uf0c1 Many vendors support sflow, but some do not. There is a partial list on the sflow web site. Most switches which support sflow will support ingress accounting, because this is what's required in RFC 3176 . Some switches (e.g. Dell Force10 running older software) only support egress sflow. If you use these on your IXP alongside other switches which only support ingress sflow, then the sflow graphs will show twice the traffic in one direction for the p2p graphs and zero traffic in the other direction. There is no way for IXP Manager to work around this problem. If not all of the IXP edge ports are sflow capable, then sflow traffic data will be lost for these ports. This means that some point-to-point traffic graphs will show up with zero traffic, and that the sflow aggregate graphs will be wrong. Sflow uses data sampling. This means that the results it produces are estimated projections, but on largee data sets, these projections tend to be statistically accurate. Each switch or switch port needs to be configured with an sflow sampling rate. The exact rate chosen will depend on the traffic levels on the switch, how powerful the switch management plane CPU is, and how much bandwidth is available for the switch management. On a small setup with low levels of traffic (e.g. 100kpps), it would be sensible to leave the sampling rate low (e.g. 1:1024). Alternatively, a busy 100G port may need a sampling rate of 1:32768 may turn out to be too low if the port is seeing large numbers of packets. If the switch or the entire network is handling very large quantities of traffic, this figure should be high enough that IXP ports with low quantities of traffic will still get good quality graphs, but low enough that the switch management CPU isn't trashed, and that packets are not dropped on the management ethernet port. Some switches have automatic rate-limiting built in for sflow data export. The sampling rate needs to be chosen so that sflow data export rate limiting doesn't kick in. If it does, samples will be lost and this will cause graph inaccuracies. Switch Implementation Limitations \uf0c1 Netflow \uf0c1 IXP Manager does not support netflow and support is not on the roadmap. This is because most netflow implementations do not export mac address information, which means that they cannot provide workable mac layer peer-to-peer statistics. Cisco Switches \uf0c1 Of Cisco's entire product range, only the Nexus 3000 and Nexus 9000 product range support sflow. Also, the sflow support on the Cisco Nexus 3k range is crippled due to the NX-OS software implementation, which forces ingress+egress sflow to be configured on specified ports rather than ingress-only. Functional accounting requires ingress-only or egress-only sflow to be configured on a per-port basis: ingress + egress causes double-counting of packets. It may be possible to work around this limitation using the broadcom shell using something like the following untested configuration: n3k# conf t n3k(config)# feature sflow n3k(config)# sflow data-source interface Ethernet1/1 n3k(config)# ^Z n3k# test hardware internal bcm-usd bcm-diag-shell Available Unit Numbers: 0 bcm-shell.0 PortSampRate xe0 4096 0 bcm-shell.0 PortSampRate xe0 xe0: ingress: 1 out of 4096 packets, egress: not sampling, bcm-shell.0 quit n3k# Note that this command is not reboot persistent, and any time a TIX24X is rebooted, the command needs to be re-entered manually. Note also that this configuration is untested. Brocade TurboIron 24X \uf0c1 By default a TIX24X will export 100 sflow records per second. This can be changed using the following command: SSH@Switch# dm device-command 2762233 SSH@Switch# tor modreg CPUPKTMAXBUCKETCONFIG(3) PKT_MAX_REFRESH=0xHHHH ... where HHHH is the hex representation of the number of sflow records per second. INEX has done some very primitive usage profiling which suggests that going above ~3000 sflow records per second will trash the management CPU too hard, so we use PKT_MAX_REFRESH=0x0BB8. Note that this command is not reboot persistent, and any time a TIX24X is rebooted, the command needs to be re-entered manually. Dell Force10 \uf0c1 Earlier versions of FTOS only support egress sflow, but support for ingress sflow was added in 2014. If you intend to deploy IXP Manager sflow accounting on a Dell F10 switch, then you should upgrade to a software release which supports ingress sflow. Cumulus Linux \uf0c1 Cumulus Linux uses hsflowd, which does not allow the operator to enable or disable sflow on a per-port basis, nor does it permit the operator to configure ports to use ingress-only sflow. This configuration needs to be handled using the /usr/lib/cumulus/portsamp command, which is not reboot persistent. It is strongly recommended to handle this configuration using orchestration, as it is not feasible to manually maintain this configuration. Fanout \uf0c1 Configuring sflowtool fan-out \uf0c1 The sflow data from all the IXP switches will normally be directed at a single sflow collector. Often it is useful to have multiple copies of this sflow data stream so that the sflow data can be processed in different ways. IXP Manager uses sflow data for two separate components: point-to-point ixp traffic graphs detecting BGP live sessions on the exchange and using the info to update the peering matrix This means that IXP Manager needs two separate sflow feeds. This can be achieved by using the sflowtool fanout facility, which sends an exact copy of all incoming sflow records to a list of destinations. For example, the following command listens for incoming sflow data on port 6343 and send three copies out. Two copies are directed to different ports on the same server, on ports 5500 and 5501. The third copy is sent to 192.0.2.20, port 6343. # sflowtool -4 -p 6343 -f 127.0.0.1/5500 -f 127.0.0.1/5501 -f 192.0.2.20/6343 This example could be used for handling P2P traffic graphs and BGP session detection on one machine, while sending a third sflow data feed to a separate server for IXP development or debugging. The two local sflow feeds can be read using sflowtool : # sflowtool -4 -p 5500 -l # sflowtool -4 -p 5501 -l The sflowtool fanout daemon should be started by the normal operating system daemon startup mechanism, e.g. script in a rc.d or init.d directory, or by a manual entry in /etc/rc.local . If running sflowtool version 3.23 or greater, it is important to use the -4 command-line parameter in sflowtool because otherwise it will listen on both ipv4 and ipv6 sockets. If you have an sflowtool process attempting to listen on a wildcard socket, it will stop other sflowtool processes from starting.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"features/sflow/#introduction","text":"IXP Manager can use sflow data to: analyse BGP flows over the exchange and use the data to create a peering matrix build peer-to-peer traffic graphs The peer-to-peer traffic graphs show traffic aggregate analysis of bytes/packets, split by VLAN and protocol (IPv4 / IPv6), both for individual IXP peering ports and entire VLANs.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"features/sflow/#helicopter-view","text":"Sflow needs to be configured with an \"accounting perimeter\". This means that ingress sflow accounting should be enabled on all edge ports, but should not be enabled on any of the core ports. This approach ensures that all packets entering or leaving the IXP are counted exactly once, when they enter the IXP fabric. All the switches at the IXP should be configured to send sflow packets to the IP address of your sflow collector. This will probably be the same server that you use for your IXP Manager sflow peer-to-peer graphing. If sflow is enabled on any of the core ports or sflow is enabled in both directions (ingress + egress), traffic will be double-counted and this will lead to incorrect graphs. Each switch on the network sends sampled sflow packets to an sflow collector. These packets are processed by the \"sflowtool\" command, which converts into an easily-parseable ascii format. IXP Manager provides a script to read the output of the sflowtool command, correlate this against the IXP database and to use this to build up a matrix of traffic flows which are then exported to an RRD database. The RRD files are stored on disk and can be accessed by using the sflow graphing system included in IXP Manager.","title":"Helicopter View"},{"location":"features/sflow/#sflow-on-switches","text":"Many vendors support sflow, but some do not. There is a partial list on the sflow web site. Most switches which support sflow will support ingress accounting, because this is what's required in RFC 3176 . Some switches (e.g. Dell Force10 running older software) only support egress sflow. If you use these on your IXP alongside other switches which only support ingress sflow, then the sflow graphs will show twice the traffic in one direction for the p2p graphs and zero traffic in the other direction. There is no way for IXP Manager to work around this problem. If not all of the IXP edge ports are sflow capable, then sflow traffic data will be lost for these ports. This means that some point-to-point traffic graphs will show up with zero traffic, and that the sflow aggregate graphs will be wrong. Sflow uses data sampling. This means that the results it produces are estimated projections, but on largee data sets, these projections tend to be statistically accurate. Each switch or switch port needs to be configured with an sflow sampling rate. The exact rate chosen will depend on the traffic levels on the switch, how powerful the switch management plane CPU is, and how much bandwidth is available for the switch management. On a small setup with low levels of traffic (e.g. 100kpps), it would be sensible to leave the sampling rate low (e.g. 1:1024). Alternatively, a busy 100G port may need a sampling rate of 1:32768 may turn out to be too low if the port is seeing large numbers of packets. If the switch or the entire network is handling very large quantities of traffic, this figure should be high enough that IXP ports with low quantities of traffic will still get good quality graphs, but low enough that the switch management CPU isn't trashed, and that packets are not dropped on the management ethernet port. Some switches have automatic rate-limiting built in for sflow data export. The sampling rate needs to be chosen so that sflow data export rate limiting doesn't kick in. If it does, samples will be lost and this will cause graph inaccuracies.","title":"Sflow on Switches"},{"location":"features/sflow/#switch-implementation-limitations","text":"","title":"Switch Implementation Limitations"},{"location":"features/sflow/#netflow","text":"IXP Manager does not support netflow and support is not on the roadmap.

As such, how to skin a page will depend on whether the template is found in resources/views (v4) or application/[modules/xxx/]views (v3). Both are covered here. IXP Manager supports template/view skinning allowing users to substitute any of their own templates in place of the default ones shipped with IXP Manager. Skinning in Version =v4 \uf0c1 First, set the following parameter in .env : VIEW_SKIN=\"example\" Skins should then be placed in the resources/skins/example directory ( example should be substituted for whatever you want to call your own skin). The default templates can be found in resources/views directory. INEX bundles its own skinned templates in resources/skins/inex as an example. Once a skin is enabled from .env , then any templates found in the skin directory (using the same directory structure as found under resouces/views ) will take precedence over the default template file. This means you do not need to recreate / copy all the default files - just replace the ones you want. In previous versions of IXP Manager , we used Smarty as the templating engine. This meant that if someone wanted to help improve IXP Manager then they would need to become familiar with PHP and Smarty. In v4 we dropped Smarty and, rather than using another compiled templating engine, we have decided to go with native PHP templates. For this, we are using Foil - Foil brings all the flexibility and power of modern template engines to native PHP templates. Write simple, clean and concise templates with nothing more than PHP. Also, simulaneously supported are Lavael's own Blade templates which we sometimes use for simple pages. Example \uf0c1 The graphing MRTG configuration generator allows for custom configuration content at the top and bottom of the file. In order to have your custom configuration enabled, you need to skin two files. Here's an example: # position ourselves in the IXP Manager root directory cd ${IXPROOT} # make the skin directory mkdir resources/skins/example # create the full path required for the MRTG configuration files: mkdir -p resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg # copy over the customisation files: cp views/services/grapher/mrtg/custom-header.foil.php resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg cp views/services/grapher/mrtg/custom-footer.foil.php resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg # edit the above files as required vi resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg/custom-header.plates.php vi resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg/custom-footer.plates.php Then, finally, edit .env and set the skin to use: VIEW_SKIN=\"example\" You can of course skin any file including the non-custom MRTG files as suits your needs. Custom Variables / Configuration Options \uf0c1 When you are skinning your own templates, you may find you need to create custom configuration options for values you do not want to store directly in your own templates. For this, we have a configuration file which is excluded from Git. Initiate it via:: cp config/custom.php.dist config/custom.php This is Laravel's standard configuration file format (which is an associative PHP array). You can also use Laravel's dotenv variables here too. As an example, if you were to create a configuration option: ?php 'example' = [ 'key' = 'my own config value', ], then in code this would be accessible as: ?php config( \"custom.example.key\", \"default value if not set|null\" ) where the second parameter is a default option if the requested configuration setting has not been defined (which defaults to null ). In templates, this can be accessed the same way or rendered in the template with:: ?= config( \"custom.example.key\", \"default\" ) ? Skinning Old Templates ( v4.9) \uf0c1 This is still important as IXP Manager v4 still uses most of the previous templates.

Finding Templates \uf0c1 Usually there is one of two places to find a template: New pages in =v4: resources/views/$controller/$action Old pages from v4: application/views/$controller/$action If you're skinning, then there's an extra two places: New pages in =v4: resources/skins/$skin/$controller/$action Old pages from v4: application/views/_skins/$skin/$controller/$action The indicated variables above mean: $controller : typically the first part of the URL (after the main IXP Manager site) for the page you are looking at.

We use a standard Ubuntu 18.04 installation (selecting the minimal virtual server option), 2 vCPUs, 2GB RAM, 10GB LVM hard drive. Rather than running Routinator as the root user, we create a dedicated user: useradd -c 'Routinator 3000' -d /srv/routinator -m -s /bin/bash -u 1100 routinator We then install the required software. build-essential is a Ubuntu alias package that installs the common C software build suite. cargo is Rust's package manager and installing that automatically installs other Rust dependancies. apt install -y build-essential cargo To install Routinator, we then switch to the routinator user and use Cargo to build and install it: sudo su - routinator cargo install routinator To check if this works, run the following (and note the path to the routinator binary): routinator@rpki01:~$ /srv/routinator/.cargo/bin/routinator -V Routinator 0.4 Routinator needs to prepare its working environment via the init command, which will set up both the directory for the local RPKI cache as well as the TAL directory. Running it will prompt you to agree to the ARIN Relying Party Agreement (RPA) so it can install the ARIN TAL along with the other four RIR TALs: /srv/routinator/.cargo/bin/routinator init To agree with the ARIN RPA, run: /srv/routinator/.cargo/bin/routinator init --accept-arin-rpa You can then test by running the following (this command prints the validated ROA payloads and increases the log level to show the process in detail at least once): /srv/routinator/.cargo/bin/routinator -v vrps To upgrade Routinator, you reinstall it ( -f to overwrite the older version): cargo install -f routinator After you upgrade, kill the running version of Routinator and start it again.

Accessibility of Aggregate Graphs \uf0c1 By default, the following graphs are publically accessible in IXP Manager and available through the top menu under Statistics : aggregate bits/sec and packets/sec graphs for the IXP; aggregate bits/sec and packets/sec graphs for the infrastructures; aggregate bits/sec graphs on a per-protocol and per-VLAN basis (requires sflow ); aggregate graphs for the switches; and aggregate graphs for the trunk connections.

Let's first look at supported graphs: ixp : aggregate graph for an IXP's overall traffic. id , which defaults to 1 , is the primary key of the IXP from the ixp database table. As IXP Manager does not support multiple IXPs, this defaults to id=1 . [Currently only supported via MRTG for protocol=all ] infrastructure : aggregate graph for the overall traffic on a specific IXP infrastructure. For many IXPs, they'll just have a single infrastructure and this will go unused as it would be the equivalent of ixp above. id , which is mandatory, is the primary key of the infrastructure from the infrastructure database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for protocol=all ] vlan : aggregate graph for a specific VLAN. id , which is mandatory, is the primary key of the VLAN from the vlan database table. [Currently only supported via sflow for protocol=ipv4|ipv6 and category=bits|pkts ] switch : aggregate graph of all peering traffic being switched by a specific switch (sum of all customer ports plus core ports). id , which is mandatory, is the primary key of the switch from the switch database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for protocol=all ] trunk : a legacy hold over from Inter-Switch / Trunk Graphs above to be replaced with core bundles. physicalinterface : traffic for an individual member port - a single physical switch port. id , which is mandatory, is the primary key of the physical interface from the physicalinterface database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for protocol=all ] virtualinterface : if a member has a single connection (one switch port) then this is the same as physicalinterface above. However, if they have a LAG port then it's the aggregate traffic for all physical ports in the LAG. id , which is mandatory, is the primary key of the virtual interface from the virtualinterface database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for protocol=all ] customer : the aggregate traffic for all ports belonging to a customer across all infrastructures. id , which is mandatory, is the primary key of the customer from the cust database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for protocol=all ] vlaninterface : aggregate traffic flowing through a members VLAN interface for a specific protocol. id , which is mandatory, is the primary key of the VLAN interface from the vlaninterface database table. [Currently only supported via sflow for protocol=ipv4|ipv6 ] latency : latency graphs (e.g. Smokeping). id , which is mandatory, is the primary key of the VLAN interface from the vlaninterface database table. protocol=ipv4|ipv6 is also mandatory. Periods for Smokeping are different to the default periods and should be one of 3hours|30hours|10days|1year . p2p : peer to peer traffic between two member VLAN interfaces. The source ( svli ) and destination ( dvli ) VLAN interface IDs are required. svli and dvli , which are mandatory, are primary keys of the VLAN interfaces from the vlaninterface database table. [Currently only supported via sflow for protocol=ipv4|ipv6 ] For additional options, it's always best to manually or programmatically examine the output for type=json to see what is supported. The following is a general list. type : one of: json - as demonstrated and described above; log - MRTG log file type output formatted as a JSON array; rrd - the RRD file for the requested graph type; png - the graph image itself (default). potentially others as supported / implemented by newer backends. period : one of day , week , month , year (except for latency graphs as described above). category : one of bits , pkts (packets), errs (errors), discs (discards), bcasts (broadcasts). Bits is measured in bits per second, the rest in packets per second. protocol : one of all , ipv4 or ipv6 . backend : default is to let IXP Manager decide. Access Control \uf0c1 The grapher API can be accessed using the standard API access mechanisms . Each graph (ixp, infrastructure, etc.) has an authorise() method which determines who is allowed view a graph. For example, see IXP\\Services\\Grapher\\Graph\\VlanInterface::authorise() . The general logic is: if the graph is configured to be publicly accessible - allow if not logged in / no valid API key - deny if superuser - allow if user belongs to customer graph requested - allow otherwise - deny and log For the supported graph types, default access control is: Graph Default Access Control ixp public but respects GRAPHER_ACCESS_IXP (see above) infrastructure public but respects GRAPHER_ACCESS_INFRASTRUCTURE (see above) vlan public but respects GRAPHER_ACCESS_VLAN (see above), unless it's a private VLAN (in which case only superuser is supported currently) switch public but respects GRAPHER_ACCESS_SWITCH (see above) trunk public but respects GRAPHER_ACCESS_TRUNK (see above) physicalinterface superuser or user of the owning customer but respects GRAPHER_ACCESS_CUSTOMER (see Access to Member Graphs below) vlaninterface superuser or user of the owning customer but respects GRAPHER_ACCESS_CUSTOMER (see Access to Member Graphs below) virtualinterface superuser or user of the owning customer but respects GRAPHER_ACCESS_CUSTOMER (see Access to Member Graphs below) customer superuser or user of the owning customer but respects GRAPHER_ACCESS_CUSTOMER (see Access to Member Graphs below) latency superuser or user of the owning customer but respects GRAPHER_ACCESS_LATENCY (see Access to Member Graphs below) p2p superuser or user of the source ( svli ) owning customer but respects GRAPHER_ACCESS_P2P (see Access to Member Graphs below) Access to Member Graphs \uf0c1 NB: before you read this section, please first read and be familiar with the Accessibility of Aggregate Graphs section above.

I.e. no one but the customer or a superadmin can access the respective graph. If you wish to allow access to these to a less than or equal user permission , set the above in .env appropriately. For example: to allow public access to all customer graphs (customer aggregate, LAG aggregates, physical interfaces and per-VLAN/protocol graphs); to allow any logged in customer access any other customer's peer to peer graphs; and to continue to restrict latency graph access to superadmins and the owning customer then set the following in .env : GRAPHER_ACCESS_CUSTOMER=0 GRAPHER_ACCESS_P2P=1 Note that GRAPHER_ACCESS_LATENCY is omitted as we are not changing the default. Please note the following: GRAPHER_ACCESS_CUSTOMER applies to customer aggregate graphs, customer LAG graphs (virtualinterface), customer ports (physicalinterface) and customer vlaninterface. T individually limit these makes little sense and drastically increases complexity (from a UI perspectve). It makes limited sense for UI access to enable either GRAPHER_ACCESS_P2P or GRAPHER_ACCESS_LATENCY without enabling equivalent or less restrictive access to GRAPHER_ACCESS_CUSTOMER .

Grapher is a complete rewrite of all previous graphing code and includes: API access to graphs and graph statistics multiple backends (such as MRTG, sflow, Smokeping) with dynamic resolution of appropriate backend configuration generation where required consistent and flexible OOP design To date, we have developed the following reference backend implementations: dummy - a dummy grapher that just provides a placeholder graph for all possible graph types; mrtg - MRTG graphing using either the log or rrd backend. Use cases for MRTG are L2 interface statistics for bits / packets / errors / discards / broadcasts per second. Aggregate graphs for customer LAGs, overall customer traffic, all traffic over a switch / infrastructure / the entire IXP are all supported. sflow - while the MRTG backend looks at layer 2 statistics, sflow is used to provide layer 3 statistics such as per protocol (IPv4/6) graphs and peer to peer graphs. smokeping - (available from v4.8.0) which creates latency graphs and this replaces the previous way we used to access Smokeping graphs. In a typical production environment, you'd implement MRTG, Smokeping and sflow to provide the complete set of features. Configuration \uf0c1 There is only a handful of configuration options required and a typical and complete $IXPROOT/.env would look like this: GRAPHER_BACKENDS=\"mrtg|sflow|smokeping\" GRAPHER_CACHE_ENABLED=true GRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_DBTYPE=\"rrd\" GRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_WORKDIR=\"/srv/mrtg\" GRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_LOGDIR=\"/srv/mrtg\" GRAPHER_BACKEND_SFLOW_ENABLED=true GRAPHER_BACKEND_SFLOW_ROOT=\"http://sflow-server.example.com/grapher-sflow\" GRAPHER_BACKEND_SMOKEPING_ENABLED=true GRAPHER_BACKEND_SMOKEPING_URL=\"http://smokeping-server.example.com/smokeping\" For those interested, the complete Grapher configuration file can be seen in [ $IXPROOT/config/grapher.php](https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/blob/master/config/grapher.php). Remember: put your own local changes in .env` rather than editing this file directly. The global (non-backend specific) options are: GRAPHER_BACKENDS - in a typical production environment this would be \"mrtg|sflow|smokeping\" which means try the MRTG backend first, then sflow and then smokeping . We ship with this set as \"dummy\" so you can see sample graphs working out of the box. GRAPHER_CACHE_ENABLED - the IXP industry standard for graphing is to graph at 5min intervals. With the cache enabled, IXP Manager does not have to regenerate / reload / reprocess log / rrd / image files if we have cached them and they are less than 5mins old.

In a typical production environment, you'd implement MRTG, Smokeping and sflow to provide the complete set of features.","title":"Grapher - Introduction"},{"location":"grapher/introduction/#configuration","text":"There is only a handful of configuration options required and a typical and complete $IXPROOT/.env would look like this: GRAPHER_BACKENDS=\"mrtg|sflow|smokeping\" GRAPHER_CACHE_ENABLED=true GRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_DBTYPE=\"rrd\" GRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_WORKDIR=\"/srv/mrtg\" GRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_LOGDIR=\"/srv/mrtg\" GRAPHER_BACKEND_SFLOW_ENABLED=true GRAPHER_BACKEND_SFLOW_ROOT=\"http://sflow-server.example.com/grapher-sflow\" GRAPHER_BACKEND_SMOKEPING_ENABLED=true GRAPHER_BACKEND_SMOKEPING_URL=\"http://smokeping-server.example.com/smokeping\" For those interested, the complete Grapher configuration file can be seen in [ $IXPROOT/config/grapher.php](https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/blob/master/config/grapher.php). Remember: put your own local changes in .env` rather than editing this file directly. The global (non-backend specific) options are: GRAPHER_BACKENDS - in a typical production environment this would be \"mrtg|sflow|smokeping\" which means try the MRTG backend first, then sflow and then smokeping . We ship with this set as \"dummy\" so you can see sample graphs working out of the box. GRAPHER_CACHE_ENABLED - the IXP industry standard for graphing is to graph at 5min intervals. With the cache enabled, IXP Manager does not have to regenerate / reload / reprocess log / rrd / image files if we have cached them and they are less than 5mins old. This is enabled by default which is the recommended setting. Backend specific configuration and set-up instructions can be found in their own sections below.","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"grapher/mrtg/","text":"Backend: MRTG \uf0c1 MRTG is used to generate interface graphs. MRTG is a particularly efficient SNMP poller as, irrespective of how many times an interface is referenced for different graphs, it is only polled once per run. If you want to understand MRTG related options in this section, please refer to MRTG's own documentation . Per-second graphs are generated for bits, packets, errors, discards and broadcasts at 5min intervals. IXP Manager 's Grapher system can use MRTG to poll switches and create traffic graphs for: Aggregate IXP and Infrastructure Graphs The MRTG script creates aggregate graphs for the entire IXP as well as per-infrastructure graphs. These graphs are available from the Statistics menu under Overall Peering Graphs . Also, the graphs on the admin dashboard are versions of these. IXP and infrastructure graphs are aggregate graphs of edge / member ports only. It is the aggregate of traffic exchanged between the members of the IXP and thus does not include core / trunk ports between switches. You'll find examples of IXP graphs and infrastructure graphs on INEX's own IXP Manager where they are public be default. Switch Aggregate Graphs These are defined and built automatically from the switches you have defined. These graphs are available from the Statistics menu under Switch Aggregate Graphs . These graphs are the aggregate of all peering ports and core/trunk ports on a given switch. It is the aggregate of traffic being exchanged across a given switch. You'll find examples of switch graphs on INEX's own IXP Manager where they are public be default. Inter-Switch / Trunk Graphs IXP Manager does not currently support a frontend means of creating these definitions (but, as of mid 2018, it is being worked on). For now, we do it manually via the IXP Manager v3 way . These graphs will be available in the Statistics menu under Inter-Switch / PoP Graphs . You can see examples from INEX here . Customer Graphs MRTG creates: per port (physical interface); per LAG (virtual interface); and per customer aggregate graphs for each member / customer. MRTG Setup and Configuration \uf0c1 You need to install some basic packages for MRTG to work - on Ubuntu for example, install: apt install rrdtool mrtg You also need a folder to store all MRTG files. For example: mkdir -p /srv/mrtg In your `.env, you need to set the following options: # The MRTG database type to use - either log or rrd: GRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_DBTYPE=\"rrd\" # Where to store log/rrd/png files. This is from the perspective # of the mrtg daemon and it is only used when generating the mrtg configuration # file so this should be a local path on whatever server mrtg will run: GRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_WORKDIR=\"/srv/mrtg\" # Where IXP Manager can fine the GRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_WORKDIR above. If mrtg is # running on the same server as IXP Manager, this this would just be the same: GRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_LOGDIR=\"/srv/mrtg\" # Note that if you wish to run MRTG on another server, you can expose the # WORKDIR on a HTTP server and provide a URL to this option: # GRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_LOGDIR=\"http://collector.example.com/mrtg\" Generating MRTG Configuration \uf0c1 You can now generate a MRTG configuration by executing a command such as: # Move to the directory where you have installed IXP Manager (typically: /srv/ixpmanager) cd $IXPROOT # Generate MRTG configuration and output to stdout: php artisan grapher:generate-configuration -B mrtg # Generate MRTG configuration and output to a named file: php artisan grapher:generate-configuration -B mrtg -O /tmp/mrtg.cfg.candidate You could also combine a syntax check before putting the resultant file live. Here's a complete example that could be run via cron: #! /usr/bin/env bash # Set this to the directory where you have installed IXP Manager (typically: /srv/ixpmanager) IXPROOT=/srv/ixpmanager # Temporary configuration file: TMPCONF=/tmp/mrtg.cfg.$$ # Synchronize configuration files ${IXPROOT}/artisan grapher:generate-configuration -B mrtg -O $TMPCONF # Remove comments and date/time stamps for before comparing for differences cat /etc/mrtg.cfg | egrep -v '^#.*$' | \\ egrep -v '^[ ]+Based on configuration last generated by.*$' /tmp/mrtg.cfg.filtered cat $TMPCONF | egrep -v '^#.*$' | \\ egrep -v '^[ ]+Based on configuration last generated by.*$' ${TMPCONF}.filtered diff /tmp/mrtg.cfg.filtered ${TMPCONF}.filtered /dev/null DIFF=$? rm /tmp/mrtg.cfg.filtered rm ${TMPCONF}.filtered if [[ $DIFF -eq 0 ]]; then rm ${TMPCONF} exit 0 fi /usr/bin/mrtg --check ${TMPCONF} /bin/mv ${TMPCONF} /etc/mrtg.cfg If your MRTG collector is on a different server, you could use a script such as the following to safely update MRTG via IXP Manager's API . #! /usr/bin/env bash # Temporary configuration file: TMPCONF=/etc/mrtg.cfg.$$ # Download the configuration via the API. Be sure to replace 'your_api_key' # with your actual API key (see API documenation). curl --fail -s -H \"X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: your_api_key\" \\ https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/grapher/mrtg-config ${TMPCONF} if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then echo \"WARNING: COULD NOT FETCH UP TO DATE MRTG CONFIGURATION!\" exit -1 fi cd /etc # Remove comments and date/time stamps for before comparing for differences cat mrtg.cfg | egrep -v '^#.*$' | \\ egrep -v '^[ ]+Based on configuration last generated by.*$' mrtg.cfg.filtered cat ${TMPCONF} | egrep -v '^#.*$' | \\ egrep -v '^[ ]+Based on configuration last generated by.*$' ${TMPCONF}.filtered diff mrtg.cfg.filtered ${TMPCONF}.filtered /dev/null DIFF=$? rm mrtg.cfg.filtered rm ${TMPCONF}.filtered if [[ $DIFF -eq 0 ]]; then rm ${TMPCONF} exit 0 fi /usr/bin/mrtg --check ${TMPCONF} /bin/mv ${TMPCONF} /etc/mrtg.cfg Note that the MRTG configuration that IXP Manager generates instructs MRTG to run as a daemon. On FreeBSD, MRTG comes with an initd script by default and you can kick it off on boot with something like the following in /etc/rc.conf : mrtg_daemon_enable=\"YES\" mrtg_daemon_config=\"/etc/mrtg.cfg\" However, on Ubuntu it does not but it comes with a /etc/cron.d/mrtg file which kicks it off every five minutes (it will daemonize the first time and further cron jobs will have no effect). To start and stop it via standard initd scripts on Ubuntu, use an initd script such as this: ubuntu-mrtg-initd ( source ): cp ${IXPROOT}/tools/runtime/mrtg/ubuntu-mrtg-initd /etc/init.d/mrtg chmod +x /etc/init.d/mrtg update-rc.d mrtg defaults /etc/init.d/mrtg start And disable the default cron job for MRTG on Ubuntu ( /etc/cron.d/mrtg ). Customising the Configuration \uf0c1 Generally speaking, you should not customize the way IXP Manager generates MRTG configuration as the naming conventions are tightly coupled to how IXP Manager fetches the graphs. However, if there are bits of the MRTG configuration you need to alter, you can do it via skinning . The skinning documentation actually uses MRTG as an example. Inserting Traffic Data Into the Database / Reporting Emails \uf0c1 The MRTG backend inserts daily summaries into MySQL for reporting. See the traffic_daily database table for this. Essentially, there is a row per day per customer for traffic types bits, discards, errors, broadcasts and packets . Each row has a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly value for average, max and total. From IXP Manager = v5.0, the task scheduler handles collecting and storing yesterday's data. If you are using an older version, create a cron job such as: 0 2 * * * www-data /srv/ixpmanager/artisan grapher:upload-stats-to-db In the IXP Manager application, this data powers the League Table function on the left hand menu. This data is also used to send email reports / notifications of various traffic events. A sample crontab for this would look like the following: 0 4 * * * www-data /srv/ixpmanager/artisan grapher:email-traffic-deltas \\ --stddev=1.5 -v user1@example.com,user2@example.com 30 10 * * tue www-data /srv/ixpmanager/artisan grapher:email-port-utilisations \\ --threshold=80 user1@example.com,user2@example.com 31 10 * * * www-data /srv/ixpmanager/artisan grapher:email-ports-with-counts \\ --discards user1@example.com,user2@example.com 32 10 * * * www-data /srv/ixpmanager/artisan grapher:email-ports-with-counts \\ --errors user1@example.com,user2@example.com Which, in the order above, do: Email a report of members whose average traffic has changed by more than 1.5 times their standard deviation. Email a report of all ports with =80% utilisation yesterday. Email a report of all ports with a non-zero discard count yesterday. Email a report of all ports with a non-zero error count yesterday. This generated emails are HTML formatted with embedded graph images. Troubleshooting \uf0c1 General Notes \uf0c1 If you have difficulty getting MRTG to work, please also refer the MRTG documentation at https://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/doc/mrtg.en.html Any references to installing MRTG above are guidelines from our own experience. IXP Manager's role is to generate a configuration file for MRTG. It is up to the user to install MRTG as they deem appropriate. The above assumes that MRTG automatically reconfigures itself when the configuration changes as stated in the MRTG documentation for RunAsDaemon . We have seen inconsistent behaviors for this and if it does not work for you, you will need to add a step to restart the MRTG daemon to the reconfiguration script above (at the very end). The Ubuntu example above was a pre-systemd example. If anyone has an example of a systemd MRTG daemon configuration please provide us with some updated documentation. Missing Graphs \uf0c1 A common issue raised on the mailing list is missing customer graphs. The code which generates MRTG configuration is in the MRTG backend file (see the function getPeeringPorts() ). The conditions for a physical interface allocated to a customer to make the configuration file are: the physical interface state must be either Connected or Quarantine . the switch must be active . If you are not sure about how ports are configured in IXP Manager, please see the interfaces document . You can check the physical interface state by: goto the customer's overview page (select customer from dropdown menu on top right). select the Ports tab. edit the port via the Pencil icon next to the connection you are interested in. find the physical interface under Physical Interfaces and edit it via the Pencil icon on the right hand side of the row. Status should be either Connected or Quarantine . You can ensure a switch is active by: Select Switches from the left hand side IXP ADMIN ACTIONS menu.

While they should never be used as a tool for monitoring IXP latency or packet loss (as routers de-prioritise ICMP requests and/or may not have a suitably powerful management plane), they can act as an extremely useful tool for identifying and diagnosing customer / member issues. What we really look for here is recent changes over time. IXP Manager can configure Smokeping to monitor member routers and display those graphs in member statistic pages. Presuming it is installed. Historical Notes \uf0c1 If you have used Smokeping on IXP Manager v4.5 or between v4.5 and v4.7.3, then how the configuration is generated has changed. In versions of IXP Manager = v4.5 now simply creates the targets on a per VLAN and protocol basis. In versions =v4.8, the URL endpoint has changed from that which was used in versions between v4.5 and v4.7.3. This was done as Smokeping (latency graphs) were fully integrated into Grapher. Target Selection \uf0c1 This section explains the rules on how a member router (target) is selected to be included in the generated Smokeping configuration. When generating a list of targets per VLAN and protocol, the API call to IXP Manager will select all VLAN interfaces (member routers) where: that protocol (IPv4/6) is enabled for the member; Can Ping has been checked for that protocol; and the virtual interface pertaining to the VLAN interface has at least on physical interface in the connected state. Generating Smokeping Targets \uf0c1 You can use the IXP Manager API to get the Smokeping target configurations for a given VLAN and protocol using the following endpoint format (both GET and POST requests work): https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/grapher/config?backend=smokeping vlanid=10 protocol=ipv4 Note that in versions of IXP Manager between v4.5 and v4.7.3, this was: https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/vlan/smokeping/{vlanid}/{protocol} . In the above, the parameters are: vlanid is the database ID ( DB ID ) of the VLAN. You can find the DB ID in IXP Manager in the VLAN table (select VLANs from the left hand side menu). protocol is either ipv4 or ipv6 (while in versions between v4.5 and v4.7.3, these were just 4 and 6 respectfully) . If either of these are invalid, the API will return with a HTTP 404 response. And example of a Smokeping target in the response is: # AS112 Reverse DNS / 185.6.36.6 +++ vlanint_86_ipv4 menu = AS112 Reverse DNS (IPv4) title = Peering VLAN #1 :: AS112 Reverse DNS via 185.6.36.6 probe = FPing host = 185.6.36.6 Optional Parameters \uf0c1 You can optionally POST any of the above parameters and none, one or both of the following to change elements of the default template: level : the Smokeping level / hierarchy of the target. Defaults to +++ . probe : the probe to use when measuring latency to the target. Defaults for FPing for IPv4 and FPing6 for IPv6. An example of changing these parameters is: curl --data \"backend=smokeping protocol=ipv4 vlanid=10 level=%2B%2B probe=MyPing\" -X POST \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\ -H \"X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\" \\ https://ixpexample.com/api/v4/grapher/config Templates / Skinning \uf0c1 You can use skinning to make changes to the bundled default template or, preferably , add your own. Let's say you wanted to add your own template called mytemplate1 and your skin is named myskin . The best way to proceed is to copy the bundled example: cd $IXPROOT mkdir -p resources/skins/myskin/services/grapher/smokeping cp resources/views/services/grapher/smokeping/default.foil.php \\ resources/skins/myskin/services/grapher/smokeping/mytemplate1.foil.php You can now edit this template as required. The only constraint on the template name is it can only contain characters from the classes a-z, 0-9, - . NB: do not use uppercase characters. The following variables are available in the template: $t- vlis : array of the VLAN interfaces/targets - it is generated by the Repositories\\VlanInterface::getForProto() function . $t- vlan : instance of the Vlan entity object . $t- protocol : either 4 or 6 . $t- probe and $t- level as defined above / passed via a post request. Setting Up Smokeping \uf0c1 This section explains how to set up Smokeping with IXP Manager. We assume you already have a base install of Smokeping. Generating / Updating Targets \uf0c1 At INEX, we would use a script such as this one which is bundled with IXP Manager to (re)generate our targets by cron and update Smokeping if necessary. To use this script yourself, you just need to copy it to the appropriate Smokeping server and edit the first few lines: KEY=\"my-ixp-manager-api-key\" URL=\"https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/grapher/config?backend=smokeping\" ETCPATH=\"/etc/smokeping\" SMOKEPING=\"/usr/bin/smokeping\" SMOKEPING_RELOAD=\"/etc/rc.d/smokeping reload\" VLANS=\"1 2\" PROTOCOLS=\"ipv4 ipv6\" where: KEY is your IXP Manager API key . URL is the API endpoint as described above. ETCPATH is where the script puts the target files (named $ETCPATH/targets-vlan${vlanid}-${proto}.cfg ) SMOKEPING is the Smokeping binary command. Just used to validate the config with --check before reloading. SMOKEPING_RELOAD - the command to reload Smokeping. VLANS - space separated list of VLAN DB IDs as described above. You probably only have one of these typically. PROTOCOLS - the protocols to generate the configuration for. The script iterates over the VLAN IDs and protocols to create the individual configuration files. Using Targets in Smokeping \uf0c1 Once the above target file(s) are created, we can use them in our standard Smokeping configuration file as follows: + infra_1 menu = IXP Infrastructure 1 title = IXP Infrastructure 1 ++ vlan_1 menu = Peering VLAN 1 title = IXP Infra 1 :: Peering VLAN 1 @include targets-vlan1-ipv4.cfg @include targets-vlan1-ipv6.cfg Apache Configuration \uf0c1 You need to be able to configure IXP Manager with the base Smokeping URL such as http://www.example.com/smokeping . This should be the URL to the standard entry page to Smokeping. IXP Manager will add the trailing slash and assume the directory index is configured for the CGI script. Thus you need an Apache configuration such as: ScriptAlias /smokeping/smokeping.cgi /usr/lib/cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi Alias /smokeping /usr/share/smokeping/www Directory \"/usr/share/smokeping/www\" Options FollowSymLinks DirectoryIndex smokeping.cgi /Directory IXP Manager Configuration \uf0c1 Once you have configured Smokeping and Apache/web server as above, you really just need to set the following in your IXP Manager .env file: # Add smokeping to the grapher backends: GRAPHER_BACKENDS=\"...|smokeping|...\" # Mark it as enabled (this just affects whether certain UI elements are shown): GRAPHER_BACKEND_SMOKEPING_ENABLED=true # And set the default location to fetch the Smokeping graphs from: GRAPHER_BACKEND_SMOKEPING_URL=\"http://www.example.com/smokeping\" where the URL is as you set up in Apache above. There may be instances where you have multiple VLANs where it is not possible to have a single Smokeping instance graph latency for all of them. Particularly as the Smokeping daemon for a given VLAN needs to have an interface / IP address on that VLAN. INEX has such a situation where we have a regional exchange, INEX Cork , that is located in a different city to the main INEX LANs and IXP Manager. In this situation, you can configure Smokeping URL overrides on a per VLAN basis by creating a file called $IXPROOT/config/grapher_smokeping_overrides.php which returns an array as follows: ?php return [ 'per_vlan_urls' = [ 2 = 'http://www.example.com/smokeping', 4 = 'http://www.example2.com/smokeping', ], ]; where the array index ( 2 and 4 in the above example) is the VLAN DB ID as explained above. Any VLANs without a specific override configured in this way will fall back to the GRAPHER_BACKEND_SMOKEPING_URL setting. Viewing Smokeping in IXP Manager \uf0c1 When configured correctly, there will be a latency button available (clock icon) in the member graphs in both the member and admin sections. Troubleshooting \uf0c1 See issue #122 for a discussion on Ubuntu installation and diagnosing issues in general (relates to IXP Manager v3 but may still be useful). IXP Manager will call something like the following to fetch graphs from Smokeping: file_get_contents( 'https://www.example.com/smokeping/?.....' ) You should see these requests to Smokeping in your Smokeping web server log files. Find these and compare them to the URLs that Smokeping itself generates for its own display of the images to ensure you have everything - and especially the Smokeping URL in IXP configuration set up correctly. Also, try testing these URLs directly on the IXP Manager server via: php -r 'echo file_get_contents( \"https://...\" );'","title":"Backend: Smokeping"},{"location":"grapher/smokeping/#backend-smokeping","text":"Latency graphs are a tool for monitoring latency / packet loss to the routers of IXP partipants and they can be an invaluable asset when diagnosing many IXP issues. While they should never be used as a tool for monitoring IXP latency or packet loss (as routers de-prioritise ICMP requests and/or may not have a suitably powerful management plane), they can act as an extremely useful tool for identifying and diagnosing customer / member issues.

Typically, this means some element of framework refresh(es) every couple of years and other more incremental package upgrades with minor version upgrades. As well as the obvious reasons for this, there is also the requirement to prevent developer apathy - insisting on legacy frameworks and packages that have been EOL'd provides a major stumbling block for bringing on new developers and contributors. The current requirements for the web application are: a Linux / BSD host. MySQL version 5.7 or later. Apache / Nginx / etc. PHP = 7.3. Note that IXP Manager will not run on older versions of PHP. Memcached - optional but recommended. To complete the installation using the included config/scripts, you will also need to have installed git ( apt-get install git ) and a number of PHP extensions (see the example apt-get install below). Regrettably the potential combinations of operating systems, versions of same and then versions of PHP are too numerous to provide individual support. As such, we recommend installing IXP Manager on Ubuntu LTS 18.04 and we officially support this platform. In fact we provide a complete installation script for this - see the automated installation page for details. If you have any issues with the manual installation, the automated script should be your first reference to compare what you are doing to what we recommend.

Log into the server where you wish to install IXP Manager. Move to the directory where you wish to store the source (our examples use /srv/ixpmanager which we refer to as $IXPROOT ). Note that it should not be checked out into any web exposed directory (e.g. do not checkout to /var/www ).

First, download a copy of the composer.phar. Once you have the PHAR archive, you can either keep it in your local project directory or move to /usr/local/bin to use it globally on your system. The installation script for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS installs these via: cd $IXPROOT EXPECTED_SIGNATURE=$(wget https://composer.github.io/installer.sig -O - -q) php -r \"copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');\" ACTUAL_SIGNATURE=$(php -r \"echo hash_file('SHA384', 'composer-setup.php');\") if [ \"$EXPECTED_SIGNATURE\" = \"$ACTUAL_SIGNATURE\" ]; then sudo -u www-data bash -c \"HOME=$IXPROOT cd $IXPROOT php composer-setup.php --quiet\" rm $IXPROOT/composer-setup.php else echo -e \"\\n\\nERROR: Invalid installer signature for composer installation\" rm $IXPROOT/composer-setup.php exit 1 fi Initial Setup and Dependancies \uf0c1 Dependencies \uf0c1 Install the required PHP libraries: cd $IXPROOT php composer.phar install --no-dev --prefer-dist cp .env.example .env php artisan key:generate Database Setup \uf0c1 Use whatever means you like to create a database and user for IXP Manager. For example: CREATE DATABASE `ixp` CHARACTER SET = 'utf8mb4' COLLATE = 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci'; GRANT ALL ON `ixp`.* TO `ixp`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED BY ' pick a password! '; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; Then edit $IXPROOT/.env and set the database options: DB_HOST=localhost DB_DATABASE=ixp DB_USERNAME=ixp DB_PASSWORD=password Now create the database schema: php artisan doctrine:schema:create Some older scripts still rely on MySQL view tables. Create these with: mysql -u ixp -p ixp $IXPROOT/tools/sql/views.sql Configuration \uf0c1 Edit $IXPROOT/.env and review and set/change all parameters.

The advised way to handle this is to install v4 in parallel and then switch over (by adjusting your DNS or Apache configuration for example) to the new v4 directory/server. This documentation was compiled while performing an upgrade on three separate IXP Manager installations. Before you proceed, please check the requirements listed in the official installation instructions . If you need help, please contact us via the public mailing list . If you find that this guide is insufficient, please contribute back to this documentation . Overview \uf0c1 The upgrade process is quite involved and, depending how many IXP Manager features you use, may take the best part of a day. The general steps are: Duplicate the Database (see below) Install IXP Manager v4 (see below) Initial configuration tasks (see below), including: Configuration Update the database schema If appropriate, migrate plaintext passwords to bcrypt MRTG Graphing Migration (including peer to peer changes) (see below) Route collector / servers / AS112 configuration has changed - see here DNS / ARPA export has changed - see here Examine the new layer2 addresses feature and consideration migration - see here If you are using Bird, set up looking glasses - see here Set up you cross connect / patch panel management - see here Read up on the new skinning features and see if you need to update / duplicate any skinned files. You will note from the above that a number of features have been deprecated in favor of doing it in new ways. Our advice is to keep both v3 and v4 live in parallel and then migrate services piece meal. That way your route server configuration can continue pulling from v3 until you have set-up the v4 method. Just ensure that people do not make customer changes in either IXP Manager during this period (or, if they do, do it in both!). Deprecations / Removed Features \uf0c1 As of IXP Manager v4 (certainly =v4.5), the following are no longer available: v3 methods for generating route collector. configuration - see here for the v4 method . v3 methods for generating route server configuration - see here for the v4 method . v3 methods for generating AS112 BGP configuration - see here for the v4 method . v3 method for IRRDB updates - see here for the v4 method . TACACS+ and RADIUS templates - see old details here for TACACS+ and here for RADIUS . v3 method for DNS/ARPA generation - see here for the v4 method . Support for plaintext passwords - see below. Duplicating the Database \uf0c1 As we're installing in parallel, we want to duplicate the database. When granting permissions on the new database, use your existing IXP Manager database credentials for ease of configuration. mysql -u root -pXXX -e 'CREATE DATABASE ixp4 CHARACTER SET = \"utf8mb4\" COLLATE = \"utf8mb4_unicode_ci\";' mysqldump -u root -pXXX ixp | mysql -u root -pXXX ixp4 mysql -u root -pXXX -e 'GRANT ALL ON ixp4.* TO `ixp`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED BY \"YYY\";' # and test: mysql -u ixp -pYYY -h localhost ixp4 Install IXP Manager \uf0c1 This is very much a tl;dr version of the official installation instructions which you should review if you need additional help. Critically, these upgrade instructions were designed and tested against IXP Manager v4.5.0. You need to upgrade to this version first and then follow the v4 upgrade instructions from there . The code for IXP Manager is maintained on GitHub and the canonical repository is inex/IXP-Manager . Log into the server where you wish to install IXP Manager and move to the directory where you wish to install (we use /srv/ixpmanager here as an example and which will be referred to as $IXPROOT below). Note that it should not be checked out into any web exposed directory (e.g. do not checkout to /var/www ). IXPROOT=/srv/ixpmanager # get the source / application git clone https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager.git $IXPROOT cd $IXPROOT git checkout v4.5.0 # Using https://getcomposer.org/ composer.phar install # Using https://bower.io/ bower install # Start with the example configuration and edit. # Read the official documentation for help. # Ensure you configure the database. # More notes on this follow below. cp .env.example .env php artisan key:generate joe .env # File system permissions chown -R www-data: var/ storage/ bootstrap/cache database/Proxies Initial Configuration Tasks \uf0c1 New Local Settings / Configuration (Laravel) \uf0c1 IXP Manager v4 uses a new PHP framework (Zend Framework swapped for Laravel). As such, all the older configuration options (from application/configs/application.ini ) need to be ported to .env . The php dotenv file ( .env ) is where all the new configuration options go. These in turn are used by the configuration files under config/ . NB: Where possible, place local changes into .env rather than changing the config files as these files are under version control. See Laravel's documentation on this and email the mailing list for help. Once you have worked your way through .env , move into the $IXPROOT/config directory and - as appropriate for your own installation - examine each config file that ends in .dist . If you use / need any features in these files, copy then such as: cd $IXPROOT/config cp xxxx.php.dist xxxx.php Then edit the resultant .php file (or, better, where config() options exist, add them to .env ). These .dist files represent v3 funtionality that has not yet been fully ported to v4/Laravel. Update the Database Schema \uf0c1 There's about 50 schema changed between the end of v3 and v4.4. View the required changes with: ./artisan doctrine:schema:update --sql And apply with: ./artisan doctrine:schema:update --force Note that this may take a few minutes if you have a lot of data such as BGP session data. Migrate Plaintext Passwords to Bcrypt \uf0c1 Since v4.5, we no longer allow plaintext passwords . If you were using plaintext passwords, you need to convert them to bcrypt as follows: cd $IXPROOT # dummy run to see what happens: php artisan utils:convert-plaintext-password # really convert passwords and save to database: php artisan utils:convert-plaintext-password --force Stage One Complete \uf0c1 You should be able to point Apache / your web server at the new IXP Manager installation and log in. MRTG Graphing Migration \uf0c1 We've implemented a new graphing backend called Grapher . One of the changes is that the graphing directory structure and file-naming conventions have changed. Primarily, we've replaced non-static handles (such as database fields like customer.shortname , physicalinterface.monitorindex and switcher.name with immutable primary keys). As such, you need to both rename the statistics directory structure and regenerate the configuration. It is strongly recommended you copy your existing files and do this in parallel or, at least keep a backup. Also, stop the MRTG daemon before starting. Performing the Migration \uf0c1 First, you'll need to update your local configuration in .env by setting something like: GRAPHER_BACKENDS=\"mrtg\" GRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_LOGDIR=\"/path/to/new/mrtg/data\" GRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_WORKDIR=\"/path/to/new/mrtg/data\" GRAPHER_CACHE_ENABLED=true See the Grapher documentation for full details of what these mean. You'll then need to migrate all your MRTG files to the new naming scheme. Run the commands below twice. Once to verify the output and a second time piped to sh ( | sh ) to actually execute the commands. # set a variable for what will become the 'old' files for convenience OLDMRTG=/srv/old-mrtg # position ourselves in the IXP Manager root directory cd $IXPROOT # stop mrtg service mrtg stop # or as appropriate for your platform # Migrate IXP graphs. # # In v3 of IXP Manager, the name of this was set by a database # parameter in the IXP table called 'aggregate graph name'. # You will be able to spot it in the old MRTG files where the # old IXP file is named something like: 'ixp_peering-XXXXX-bits.log'. # The 'XXXXXX' bit is the aggregate name you need to replace in the below: php artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L $OLDMRTG -X --agg-name=XXXXXX php artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L $OLDMRTG -X --agg-name=XXXXXX | sh # Migrate infrastructure graphs. # # In v3 of IXP Manager, the name of this was set by a database # parameter in the infrastructure table called 'aggregate graph name'. # You will be able to spot it in the old MRTG files where the # old IXP file is named something like: 'ixp_peering-XXXXX-bits.log'. # The 'XXXXXX' bit is the aggregate name you need to replace in the below: php artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L $OLDMRTG -I php artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L $OLDMRTG -I | sh # Migrate switch graphs php artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L $OLDMRTG -S php artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L $OLDMRTG -S | sh # Migrate trunk graphs and configuration. # If you had not configured trunk graphs you can skip this.

IXP Manager v4 does not use this but pulls the required RRD files directly. If you have this on the same server or can expose it using NFS for example, then set the path accordingly in .env : GRAPHER_BACKEND_SFLOW_ROOT=\"/srv/ixpmatrix\" If you have implemented this via a web server on the sflow server (as we typically do at INEX), then you need to expose the RRD data directory to IXP Manager using an Apache config such as: Alias /grapher-sflow /srv/ixpmatrix Directory \"/srv/ixpmatrix\" Options None AllowOverride None RequireAny Require ip 192.0.2.0/24 Require ip 2001:db8::/32 /RequireAny /Directory and update .env for this with something like: GRAPHER_BACKEND_SFLOW_ROOT=\"http://www.example.com/grapher-sflow\"","title":"Upgrade From v3"},{"location":"install/upgrade-v3/#upgrade-from-v3","text":"Due to the significant changes between IXP Manager v3 and v4, there is no in place upgrade process.

It is a link that connects two IXP switches together to carry production IXP traffic. Before reading this, it is expected that you have read and have a good understanding of the concepts from Customer Connections . Virtual Interfaces (VIs), Physical Interfaces (PIs) and how they relate to Switch Ports (SPs) also apply here. Core Bundles Types and Database Overview \uf0c1 IXP Manager supports three types of core bundles: ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path): this is typically used when your peering LAN is built on an overlay such as VXLAN. A link between switch A and switch B is made up of one or more layer 3 links with (typically) a /31 network over each link and BGP peering sessions over each of these. L2-LAG : a layer2 LAG (link aggregate group) is one or more ports between switch A and switch B using a LAG protocol which is typically LACP. This is the appropriate core bundle type even if the link between your switches is a single L2 link without LACP. You may often run a spanning-tree protocol here also. L3-LAG : this is variation of the above two where you create a layer2 LAG with one or more ports between switch A and switch B. However, this LAG is configured as a L3 interface for running VXLAN or some other overlay network. From IXP Manager's database perspective, these all are represented as follows: From this, please note the following terminology, relationships and abbreviations which will be used throughout this document: a single Core Bundle (CB) entity (row in the database) represents the parent for all elements for the CB. when we talk about CBs, we talk about Side A and Side B - these are essentially the switches on each end/side of the CB. each CB is make up of one or more Core Links (CL). A CL is the database glue that ultimatelty connects/pairs the Switch Ports (SP) at each end. each CL has two Core Interfaces (CI). The CIs are syntactic sugar which allow us to connect into our standard Virtual Interface (VI) / Physical Interface (PI) / Switch Port (SP) schema. In a CL, the CI representing the a-side has a one-to-one relationship with a PI on the a-side and similarly for the CI representing the b-side. the PIs on each side are part of a VI. We thus inherit the same VI characteristics as customer interfaces such as whether LACP is enabled, MTU, LAG name and number, etc. VIs require a customer to own them. The customer (which is the same on both sides) is just the internal IXP Manager customer representing the IXP. each PI in turn has a one-to-one relationship with a switch port (SP). the SPs in turn all belong to the same Switch A on the a-side and Switch B on the b-side. Provisioning a Core Bundle via the Wizard \uf0c1 The only way to provision a new core bundle is to use the wizard. This can be accessed by: selecting the Core Bundles link on the left hand side menu; then, on the core bundles list page, select Add Core Bundle Wizard... from the [+ v] dropdown menu. When you open the wizard, you will see something like the following (note this example represents the options for ECMP): This can be used to provision a single port standard customer connection. If they customer needs a LAG or other non-standard options, these can be added afterwards. General Interface Settings \uf0c1 The customer should be prefilled and read-only as you enter the wizard from a specific customer overview page. You would normally just select your main / primary peering VLAN from the VLAN dropdown. There are some notable exceptions: you may have more than one peering LAN. For example, INEX runs two resilient peering networks in Dublin and a separate regional exchange called INEX Cork. These are all unique VLANs. if you are provisioning a port dedicated to a private VLAN, you would just select that VLAN but leave IPv4 Enabled and IPv6 Enabled unchecked as IP addressing on private VLANs in not within an IX's purview. at INEX we also have quarantine VLANs for each peering VLAN. You would typically not select a quarantine VLAN here during provisioning unless you are using automation. Just put the interface in the primary peering LAN and let the Physical Interface Settings (see below) look after the quarantine flag. You should check the Use 802.1q framing checkbox if the port should be tagged facing the customer. If you are not using any automation tools, this will be informational for you rather than production affecting. Checking either or both of IPv4 Enabled and IPv6 Enabled will show the IPv4 Details and IPv6 Details (as per the above image) and enable these protocols for the customer's connection. Physical Interface Settings \uf0c1 This section allows you to select the physical interface / switch port for the connection. Switch : a dropdown list of all switches. Be careful as at present this list is all active switches rather than switches on the same infrastructure as the selected VLAN from General Interface Settings . Port : the switch port to use. This is dynamically populated when the switch is selected and will only show ports of type Peering or type Unset / Unknown (these are set on a per port basis when adding / editing switches). Status : the port status currently has one of five options. They effectively work as a boolean where Connected means on/enabled and the rest mean disabled as explained below. In practice, we tend to just use three states: Connected : this is the most important. When a virtual interface has any port with the Connected state, then IXP Manager will consider this connection active and will generate router configuration, monitoring configuration, etc. Awaiting X-Connect : the customer has requested an upgrade / new port and we are awaiting for the co-location provider / customer to get the cross connect organised. Quarantine : the port is connected and is under going quarantine prior to being moved onto the production peering LAN. During quarantine, INEX checks the port to ensure only ARP, IPv4 and IPv6 packets are received (no *-discovery, STP, etc. as well as a number of other things). The Not Connected and Disabled states have the same effect as (2) and (3) above and can be used as informational settings where (2) and (3) do not apply. Speed and duplex are self explanatory. These settings in the physical interface entity are informational unless you are doing automation. They also have knock on effects to (for example) graphing - where the MRTG max value on an interface is set to this to prevent weird excessive spikes on counter rollovers. General VLAN Settings \uf0c1 These settings apply to the VLAN interface. The Max BGP Prefixes is a setting used to determine max prefixes on router BGP peers - please see the global version of this as explained in the customer section for details . If Apply IRRDB Filtering is not set, then the route servers will accept any prefixes advertised by the customer (note that the default templates will filter martians and apply a max prefix limit). Generally speaking this is a very bad idea and should only be used in exceptional cases. INEX never uses this setting - but demand from other IX's had it added. Multicast Enabled is informational only. INEX used to support multicast on the peering LAN but removed support in 2015 due to lack of interest and added complexity / cost when purchasing new switches. If Route Server Client is checked, then IXP Manager will configure a BGP peer for this connection when generating route server configurations . It is also used in other areas to show if a member uses the route servers or not, by the Peering Manager to calculate missing BGP sessions, etc. Similarly, if AS112 Client is checked, then IXP Manager will configure a BGP peer for this connection when generating AS112 router configurations . IPv4/IPv6 Details \uf0c1 When IPv4 / IPv6 Enabled is checked under General Interface Settings above, these two sections will be available. The same details apply to IPv4 and IPv6 options so we will document them together. IP Address : the IP address to assign to this customer. This is taken from available IP addresses for the VLAN selected in General Interface Settings . IP addresses are added in IXP Manager via the left hand menu under IXP Admin Actions. The dropdown also works as an input field - this allows you to enter a new IP address that does not already exist in the field. When the wizard form is submitted, the address is added and associated with the VLAN. This is most useful for the IPv6 field if you are using a non-sequential numbering plan. Hostname : if you use IXP Manager to configure your DNS ARPA entries, the hostname entered here will be returned when a PTR request is made for the assigned IP address. Enter a complete hostname without trailing period such as: www.example.com . BGP MD5 Secret : The will be used for generating router configurations . The circle refresh icon in the IPv4 section will generate a cryptographically secure secret in modern browsers. The square refresh icon in the IPv6 section will copy the value from the IPv4 section. Note that setting a MD5 here does not mean that all router configurations have to include it. MD5 can be disabled entirely by a routers configuration or by templating. Can Ping : IXP Manager generates configuration for a number of other tools such as Smokeping and Nagios which ping customer routers. These are invaluable tools for problem solving, monitoring and graphing long term trends. We enable this by default unless a customer specifically asks us not to. Can Monitor RC BGP : this is more of a legacy option for configuration builders that used to check for established route collector BGP sessions and warn if not present. This is deprecated and will be removed. Viewing / Editing an Interface \uf0c1 Once an interface has been added as per the above wizard instructions, you can view and edit the interface by selecting the edit icon against the connection you are interested in from the Ports tab on the customer overview page. When you do that, you will see a screen such as the following: You can see from the layout of this screen how it ties in with the schema explained above. Virtual Interface Details \uf0c1 The screenshot above shows the virtual interface details with the Advanced Options shown. The additional fields here that were not in the wizard are described below. Link aggregation / LAG framing is mostly informational unless you are doing automation. There are some restrictions. Namely / specifically: if you have more than one physical interface, it will require you to set this. for a single interface, checking this indicates you want LACP on a single member LAG. This is useful and often common practice as it allows upgrades without outages. The Virtual Interface Name is again mostly informational unless you are doing automation. It should be the start of the LAG name without the number. On an IOS device this would be Port-channel for example. Matched with this is the Channel Group Number with is tacked onto the end of the Virtual Interface Name . Leave it as 0 and when you check Link aggregation / LAG framing and save the changes, IXP Manager will set this to the next available unused port channel / bundle / LAG number on that switch. Both Description and MTU are informational. Physical Interfaces \uf0c1 You can add additional physical interfaces to a connection / virtual interface. This effectivily means you are creating a LAG. The form for adding additional physical interfaces is indentical to that in the wizard. VLAN Interfaces \uf0c1 The most common use case of more than one VLAN Interface is when your customer may also have private VLANs on their connection. Other than that, the VLAN interface add / edit form has all the same elements as the wizard with one addition: Busy host : this flag indicates that the customer's router is unusually slow to reply to ICMP echo requests and that when monitoring, the configuraiton should allow for warnings after a 5sec RTT rather than 1sec.","title":"Core Bundles"},{"location":"usage/core-bundles/#core-bundles","text":"DRAFT: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE - BARRYO Dec 2017 This section explains how to manage core bundles - a core bundle is sometimes called an ISL (Inter-Switch Link).

Peering Details \uf0c1 The AS Number is just the integer value without any AS prefix, etc. Max Prefixes is known as the global max prefixes value . It is used to work out the appropriate max prefixes value to apply to all router configurations in the stock / default templates (route collector and servers, AS112). The calculated value is also included in emails from the Peering Manager from customer to customer. There are two issues with max prefixes: it is also possible to set a max prefixes value on a per VLAN interface basis. This is not ideal and something we intend to fix. the same value is used for IPv4 and IPv6 which is also something that needs to be fixed. The max prefixes value is worked out in the code when generating router configuration is as follows: the greater of the global value as above or the VLAN interface value. if neither is set, a default of 250 is used. At INEX, we default to 50 for small members, and 250 for medium sized members (who may already have 50 say), and as advised by larger members. The Peering Email is used in member lists and by the Peering Manager for sending emails. We try and encourage an alias of peering@example.com but this does not always work out. The IPv4 Peering Macro is used instead of the AS number when set to generate inbound prefix filters for the route servers based on the member's published IRR records. AS-BTIRE in the RIPE database is an example for BT Ireland. The IPv6 Peering Macro was added for another IX using IXP Manager that had a customer which used a separate macro for v4 and v6. We only know of that single instance of this. In the event that IPv6 Peering Macro is set, this will be used to generate IPv6 inbound prefix filters, otherwise the IPv4 Peering Macro will be used for both. If neither is set, the IRR policy of the AS number will be used. Use AS-NULL to disable one or the other protocol peering macro if only one is required. It is not possible to have a different ASN for IPv4 and IPv6. We are not aware of any cases where this should be necessary but if it is, create two customers. The Peering Policy is informational only and is displayed in member lists. Typically speaking, route server members should have an open peering policy but others are possible if you use standard route server communities for controlling the distribution of prefixes. The IRRDB source sets the database where IXP Manager queries the customer's IRR data from. See the IRRDB feature page for more information. The checkbox labelled Active Peering Matrix indicates whether or not the customer's route server and bilateral peering sessions should appear in the public peering matrix.

It is also available to other customers of the exchange to similarly contact their bilateral peers with any issues. Reseller Details \uf0c1 This section will only be displayed if reseller functionality is enabled. See the reseller instructions for details on this. Welcome Emails \uf0c1 When a new customer is provisioned, you can send them a welcome email from IXP Manager which is a useful way to provide all their connectivity details and other on-boarding information for your IX. From the Customer Overview page, you will find the Send Welcome Email... option under the tools menu on the top right hand corner of the page: To be useful, you need to skin the welcome email. From IXP Manager v4.8.0 onwards, its format is Markdown and it is sent as a HTML email. The file you need to skin is (with an example of how to do it): cd ${IXPROOT} mkdir -p resources/skins/example/customer/emails cp resources/views/customer/emails/welcome-email.blade.php resources/skins/inex/customer/emails/ The example skin name in the above is just an example . Please read the skinning documentation . Customer Logos \uf0c1 Customer users and administrators can upload and manage logos for customers. To enable this functionality, set the following in your ${IXPROOT}/.env file: IXP_FE_FRONTEND_DISABLED_LOGO=false When you do this, the ability to manage logos will appear: under the Edit menu (top right, pencil icon) for administrators on the Customer Overview page; via a Your Logo section on the customer user's landing page after logging in.

Database Overview \uf0c1 To fully understand how IXP Manager treats customer interfaces, you need a little background on the database schema. This will also help explain why we have laid out the UI as it is. The original database schema dates from pre-2005 and has stood the test of time extremely well. The above is described as follows: Customers have a 1:n relationship with virtual interfaces (VI). A VI is a container object that represents a customer connection and all the elements that make up that connection. VIs have a 1:n relationship with physical interfaces (PI). A physical interface in turn has a 1:1 relationship with switch ports (SP). PIs represent what we say the customer has (e.g. a 1Gb port). The SP has information from the switch itself and can help identify inconsistencies with what was expected to be configured/billed and what has actually been provisioned). PIs can also move between SPs (e.g. customer upgrades / switch replacements / etc.). By schematically representing PIs and SPs as different entities, we can associate elements such as usage graphs to the PI so these remain consistent when a SP changes. Adding a second (or more) PI to a VI indicates that the port is a LAG. VIs have a 1:n relationship with VLAN interfaces (VLI). You can consider the PI element the layer2 / physical element and the VLI element the layer3 element. A VLI has a 1:1 mapping with a VLAN (typically the peering LAN). If IPv4 is enabled, the VLI has a 1:1 mapping to an IPv4 address from the given VLAN. If IPv6 is enabled, the VLI has a 1:1 mapping to an IPv6 address from the given VLAN. The VLI also indicates if this interface should have a route server peering session, MD5 passwords, etc. (all explained below). Provisioning an Interface via the Wizard \uf0c1 The best way to provision a new interface for a customer is to use the wizard. This can be accessed from the customer's overview page via a menu on the top right: When you open the wizard, you will see: This can be used to provision a single port standard customer connection. If they customer needs a LAG or other non-standard options, these can be added afterwards. General Interface Settings \uf0c1 The customer should be prefilled and read-only as you enter the wizard from a specific customer overview page. You would normally just select your main / primary peering VLAN from the VLAN dropdown. There are some notable exceptions: you may have more than one peering LAN. For example, INEX runs two resilient peering networks in Dublin and a separate regional exchange called INEX Cork. These are all unique VLANs. if you are provisioning a port dedicated to a private VLAN, you would just select that VLAN but leave IPv4 Enabled and IPv6 Enabled unchecked as IP addressing on private VLANs in not within an IX's purview. at INEX we also have quarantine VLANs for each peering VLAN. You would typically not select a quarantine VLAN here during provisioning unless you are using automation. Just put the interface in the primary peering LAN and let the Physical Interface Settings (see below) look after the quarantine flag. You should check the Use 802.1q framing checkbox if the port should be tagged facing the customer. If you are not using any automation tools, this will be informational for you rather than production affecting. Checking either or both of IPv4 Enabled and IPv6 Enabled will show the IPv4 Details and IPv6 Details (as per the above image) and enable these protocols for the customer's connection. Physical Interface Settings \uf0c1 This section allows you to select the physical interface / switch port for the connection. Switch : a dropdown list of all switches. Be careful as at present this list is all active switches rather than switches on the same infrastructure as the selected VLAN from General Interface Settings . Port : the switch port to use. This is dynamically populated when the switch is selected and will only show ports of type Peering or type Unset / Unknown (these are set on a per port basis when adding / editing switches). Status : the port status currently has one of five options. They effectively work as a boolean where Connected means on/enabled and the rest mean disabled as explained below. In practice, we tend to just use three states: Connected : this is the most important. When a virtual interface has any port with the Connected state, then IXP Manager will consider this connection active and will generate router configuration, monitoring configuration, etc. Awaiting X-Connect : the customer has requested an upgrade / new port and we are awaiting for the co-location provider / customer to get the cross connect organised. Quarantine : the port is connected and is under going quarantine prior to being moved onto the production peering LAN. During quarantine, INEX checks the port to ensure only ARP, IPv4 and IPv6 packets are received (no *-discovery, STP, etc. as well as a number of other things). The Not Connected and Disabled states have the same effect as (2) and (3) above and can be used as informational settings where (2) and (3) do not apply. Speed and duplex are self explanatory. These settings in the physical interface entity are informational unless you are doing automation. They also have knock on effects to (for example) graphing - where the MRTG max value on an interface is set to this to prevent weird excessive spikes on counter rollovers. General VLAN Settings \uf0c1 These settings apply to the VLAN interface. The Max BGP Prefixes is a setting used to determine max prefixes on router BGP peers - please see the global version of this as explained in the customer section for details . If Apply IRRDB Filtering is not set, then the route servers will accept any prefixes advertised by the customer (note that the default templates will filter martians and apply a max prefix limit). Generally speaking this is a very bad idea and should only be used in exceptional cases. INEX never uses this setting - but demand from other IX's had it added. Multicast Enabled is informational only. INEX used to support multicast on the peering LAN but removed support in 2015 due to lack of interest and added complexity / cost when purchasing new switches. If Route Server Client is checked, then IXP Manager will configure a BGP peer for this connection when generating route server configurations . It is also used in other areas to show if a member uses the route servers or not, by the Peering Manager to calculate missing BGP sessions, etc. Similarly, if AS112 Client is checked, then IXP Manager will configure a BGP peer for this connection when generating AS112 router configurations . IPv4/IPv6 Details \uf0c1 When IPv4 / IPv6 Enabled is checked under General Interface Settings above, these two sections will be available. The same details apply to IPv4 and IPv6 options so we will document them together. IP Address : the IP address to assign to this customer. This is taken from available IP addresses for the VLAN selected in General Interface Settings . IP addresses are added in IXP Manager via the left hand menu under IXP Admin Actions. The dropdown also works as an input field - this allows you to enter a new IP address that does not already exist in the field. When the wizard form is submitted, the address is added and associated with the VLAN. This is most useful for the IPv6 field if you are using a non-sequential numbering plan. Hostname : if you use IXP Manager to configure your DNS ARPA entries, the hostname entered here will be returned when a PTR request is made for the assigned IP address. Enter a complete hostname without trailing period such as: www.example.com . BGP MD5 Secret : The will be used for generating router configurations . The circle refresh icon in the IPv4 section will generate a cryptographically secure secret in modern browsers. The square refresh icon in the IPv6 section will copy the value from the IPv4 section. Note that setting a MD5 here does not mean that all router configurations have to include it. MD5 can be disabled entirely by a routers configuration or by templating. Can Ping : IXP Manager generates configuration for a number of other tools such as Smokeping and Nagios which ping customer routers. These are invaluable tools for problem solving, monitoring and graphing long term trends. We enable this by default unless a customer specifically asks us not to. Can Monitor RC BGP : this is more of a legacy option for configuration builders that used to check for established route collector BGP sessions and warn if not present. This is deprecated and will be removed. Viewing / Editing an Interface \uf0c1 Once an interface has been added as per the above wizard instructions, you can view and edit the interface by selecting the edit icon against the connection you are interested in from the Ports tab on the customer overview page. When you do that, you will see a screen such as the following: You can see from the layout of this screen how it ties in with the schema explained above. Virtual Interface Details \uf0c1 The screenshot above shows the virtual interface details with the Advanced Options shown. The additional fields here that were not in the wizard are described below. Link aggregation / LAG framing is mostly informational unless you are doing automation. There are some restrictions. Namely / specifically: if you have more than one physical interface, it will require you to set this. for a single interface, checking this indicates you want LACP on a single member LAG. This is useful and often common practice as it allows upgrades without outages. The Virtual Interface Name is again mostly informational unless you are doing automation. It should be the start of the LAG name without the number. On an IOS device this would be Port-channel for example. Matched with this is the Channel Group Number with is tacked onto the end of the Virtual Interface Name . Leave it as 0 and when you check Link aggregation / LAG framing and save the changes, IXP Manager will set this to the next available unused port channel / bundle / LAG number on that switch. Both Description and MTU are informational. Physical Interfaces \uf0c1 You can add additional physical interfaces to a connection / virtual interface. This effectivily means you are creating a LAG. The form for adding additional physical interfaces is indentical to that in the wizard. VLAN Interfaces \uf0c1 The most common use case of more than one VLAN Interface is when your customer may also have private VLANs on their connection. Other than that, the VLAN interface add / edit form has all the same elements as the wizard with one addition: Busy host : this flag indicates that the customer's router is unusually slow to reply to ICMP echo requests and that when monitoring, the configuraiton should allow for warnings after a 5sec RTT rather than 1sec.","title":"Customer Connections"},{"location":"usage/interfaces/#customer-interfaces","text":"This section explains how to set up a customer interface.","title":"Customer Interfaces"},{"location":"usage/interfaces/#database-overview","text":"To fully understand how IXP Manager treats customer interfaces, you need a little background on the database schema. This will also help explain why we have laid out the UI as it is. The original database schema dates from pre-2005 and has stood the test of time extremely well. The above is described as follows: Customers have a 1:n relationship with virtual interfaces (VI). A VI is a container object that represents a customer connection and all the elements that make up that connection. VIs have a 1:n relationship with physical interfaces (PI). A physical interface in turn has a 1:1 relationship with switch ports (SP). PIs represent what we say the customer has (e.g. a 1Gb port). The SP has information from the switch itself and can help identify inconsistencies with what was expected to be configured/billed and what has actually been provisioned). PIs can also move between SPs (e.g. customer upgrades / switch replacements / etc.). By schematically representing PIs and SPs as different entities, we can associate elements such as usage graphs to the PI so these remain consistent when a SP changes. Adding a second (or more) PI to a VI indicates that the port is a LAG. VIs have a 1:n relationship with VLAN interfaces (VLI). You can consider the PI element the layer2 / physical element and the VLI element the layer3 element. A VLI has a 1:1 mapping with a VLAN (typically the peering LAN). If IPv4 is enabled, the VLI has a 1:1 mapping to an IPv4 address from the given VLAN. If IPv6 is enabled, the VLI has a 1:1 mapping to an IPv6 address from the given VLAN. The VLI also indicates if this interface should have a route server peering session, MD5 passwords, etc. (all explained below).","title":"Database Overview"},{"location":"usage/interfaces/#provisioning-an-interface-via-the-wizard","text":"The best way to provision a new interface for a customer is to use the wizard.

These are all unique VLANs. if you are provisioning a port dedicated to a private VLAN, you would just select that VLAN but leave IPv4 Enabled and IPv6 Enabled unchecked as IP addressing on private VLANs in not within an IX's purview. at INEX we also have quarantine VLANs for each peering VLAN. You would typically not select a quarantine VLAN here during provisioning unless you are using automation. Just put the interface in the primary peering LAN and let the Physical Interface Settings (see below) look after the quarantine flag. You should check the Use 802.1q framing checkbox if the port should be tagged facing the customer.

This is dynamically populated when the switch is selected and will only show ports of type Peering or type Unset / Unknown (these are set on a per port basis when adding / editing switches). Status : the port status currently has one of five options. They effectively work as a boolean where Connected means on/enabled and the rest mean disabled as explained below. In practice, we tend to just use three states: Connected : this is the most important. When a virtual interface has any port with the Connected state, then IXP Manager will consider this connection active and will generate router configuration, monitoring configuration, etc. Awaiting X-Connect : the customer has requested an upgrade / new port and we are awaiting for the co-location provider / customer to get the cross connect organised. Quarantine : the port is connected and is under going quarantine prior to being moved onto the production peering LAN. During quarantine, INEX checks the port to ensure only ARP, IPv4 and IPv6 packets are received (no *-discovery, STP, etc. as well as a number of other things). The Not Connected and Disabled states have the same effect as (2) and (3) above and can be used as informational settings where (2) and (3) do not apply. Speed and duplex are self explanatory.

Generally speaking this is a very bad idea and should only be used in exceptional cases. INEX never uses this setting - but demand from other IX's had it added. Multicast Enabled is informational only. INEX used to support multicast on the peering LAN but removed support in 2015 due to lack of interest and added complexity / cost when purchasing new switches. If Route Server Client is checked, then IXP Manager will configure a BGP peer for this connection when generating route server configurations . It is also used in other areas to show if a member uses the route servers or not, by the Peering Manager to calculate missing BGP sessions, etc. Similarly, if AS112 Client is checked, then IXP Manager will configure a BGP peer for this connection when generating AS112 router configurations .","title":"General VLAN Settings"},{"location":"usage/interfaces/#ipv4ipv6-details","text":"When IPv4 / IPv6 Enabled is checked under General Interface Settings above, these two sections will be available.

IXP Manager provides comprehensive management features for switches (and more complex configurations such as VXLAN overlay networks). We strongly advise trying to add and manage switches in IXP Manager without SNMP. SNMP v2 is a core element of how switches work within IXP Manager including accurate port discovery, graphing, port states, optic availability, etc. Listing Switches \uf0c1 You access the switch management functionality in IXP Manager via the Switches menu option under IXP Admin Actions in the left hand side control menu. The default action is to list the configured switches: From the above screenshot, you will notice a number of features: There is a toggle button Show Active Only which will toggle the list views to show all switches (default) or only active switches. The default switch information view is shown. There are two additional list views under the top right List Mode: dropdown: OS View: shows information (where available via SNMP) about the switch software, its version, the serial number, etc. This view is useful for planning software upgrades. L3 View: when running your exchange using an overlay network such as VXLAN, this view shows the layer 3 details of your switches including AS number, loopback address, etc. The Help button on the top right links to this documentation. The plus icon on the top right is used to add new switches. In the list view above, you will also notice that there are per row / per switch options on the right: The eye (view) button shows the complete database record for a switch including all the SNMP discovered information from the Iface and MAU SNMP MIBs. The pencil button allows you to edit a switch's details. The trashcan button allows you to delete a switch. NB: a switch can only be deleted if there are no associated ports, patch panel connections, etc. Switches can alternatively be made inactive by editing it and unchecking the Active checkbox. Under SNMP Actions there are two options and the resulting view is made from a live/immediate SNMP poll: View / Edit Ports: Allows you to edit port type, port active status, etc. Please see documentation below for details. Live Port States: Shows the current port states including: name, alias/description, LAG, speed / duplex, MTU, administrative and operational state. Under Database Actions you can get information on the switches ports as recorded in the database (usually from the last time the switch was polled): View / Edit Ports: Allows you to edit port type, port active status, etc. Please see documentation below for details. Where SNMP is available, the above SNMP version of this has more features and is preferred. Port MAU Detail: MAU (Medium Attachment Units) - provides information on the XFP / SFP / etc. optics installed in a switch. If the option is disabled then it means the switch does not support the SNMP MAU MIB. Port Report: a simple report listing who is connected to each port in a switch. E.g. useful as a hardcopy when going to a datacentre. Adding and Editing Switches \uf0c1 From the list view described above , click the plus button in the top right to add a switch. Switches are added by SNMP poll so the first step is to provide a hostname and SNMP v2 community: The switch must respond to SNMP queries from the server on which IXP Manager is installed. This can be testing on the command line as follows: root@ixpmanager:~# snmpget -c yourcommunity -v 2c switch01.mgmt.example.com .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 = STRING: \"Arista Networks EOS version 4.18.0F running on an Arista Networks DCS-7280SR-48C6\" After completing the details and clicking Next , IXP Manager will poll the switch and present you with the second (and last) stage in adding a switch: The important things to note about this are: Clicking the green Help button will show individual help / instructions for each field. The hostname and SNMP community are read only here as they were entered in the previous step and the additional details pre-filled were discovered by a SNMP poll. The name of the switch is how you want it shown in various sections of IXP Manager. We recommend using the hostname of the fully-qualified-domain-name of the switch. Regardless of what you use, please do not use periods, spaces or non-alphanumeric characters besides dashes and underscores. The vendor and model are prefilled where IXP Manager could successfully identify them based on platform discovery - see below . If the vendor does not exist in the dropdown, it can be added via the Vendors option in the left-hand menu. The elements under Management Configuration are not used directly by IXP Manager but can be used for orchestration and automated provisioning (as it used by INEX - see here ). The elements under Layer 3 Configuration are not used directly by IXP Manager but can be used for orchestration and automated provisioning of overlay networks such as VXLAN (as it used by INEX - see here ). Platform Discovery \uf0c1 The discovery of a switches vendor, model, operating system details and serial number - as well as MAU details - is achieved via a third party package called OSS_SNMP . While this shares an author in common with IXP Manager, it is a separate project. If your switch is not discovered automatically, you can open a ticket with the OSS_SNMP project directly and ensure you provide the details requested here . Managing Switch Ports \uf0c1 Recall the per row / per switch options on the right hand side of each switch's row when listing switches: These options allow you to list and manage switch ports. Of these, the most relevant is the View / Edit Ports under SNMP Actions which leads to a page as follows: The page allows you to: Change the port type dynamically via AJAX on a per port basis (the column of Unset / Unknown dropdowns). Select a group of ports (and optionally invert the selection via the square refresh icon) or select all ports. Then, with the selected ports: delete them change their type set them as active / inactive Note that deleting ports is not a permanent action if the port physically exists and is discovered in a subsequent SNMP poll. Switch Port Types \uf0c1 While some of these are clear from the name, we will explain each type here for completeness: Unset / Unknown: no type has been set. A port is automatically set to Peering or Core when it is assigned to a customer / core bundle. Peering: peering port assigned to a customer. Automatically set when the port is assigned to a customer. Monitor: a port used for monitoring / mirroring traffic from another port. These ports are used by INEX when provisioning a new customer during what we call our quarantine process . This allows us to ensure the customer end is configured correctly without discovery protocols (CDP, LLDP, etc.), keepalives, no unexpected tagged packets, etc. Core: a core / inter-switch link port. This is automatically set when a port is added to a core bundle. Other: a purpose other than what we have provided options for. Management: management access to a switch. Fanout and Reseller : used for reseller functionality . Automated Polling / SNMP Updates \uf0c1 Switch and switch port information in the database can go stale very quickly. As such, IXP Manager will poll switches using SNMP hourly via the task scheduler . You can do it manually via the Artisan command: /srv/ixpmanager/artisan switch:snmp-poll The command signature is: switch:snmp-poll [--log] [--noflush] [-q, --quiet] [ switch ] where: [-q, --quiet] does not output anything unless there is an error. Should be used for cron jobs. [--log] outputs detailed SNMP polling information to /srv/ixpmanager/storage/logs/laravel.log . You can tail this file when running it to help diagnose any issues. [--noflush] polls the switch but does not write anything to the database. [ switch ] allows you to optionally limit the polling to a single named switch (the switch's name, not hostname). If not specified, all switches are polled. Not that inactive switches are not polled unless an inactive switch name is explicitly specified. Migrating Customers to a New Switch \uf0c1 When moving IXP customers from one switch to another, add the new switch into the IXP Manager as described above. The customer port assignments can easily be changed to the new switch using the IXP Manager web interface. It is advisable not to delete the old port assignment and create a new one, because if this happens, then the old customer port graphs will not be preserved. The process is, for each customer: find the customer's overview page on IXP Manager (chose customer from top right dropdown) find and edit the relevant port under the Ports edit the physical interface of each port being moved chose the new switch and switch port save the changes When the switch port updates have been completed, it's advisable to rebuild the mrtg configuration using the CLI tool and (if using dynamically discovered MAC addresses) also to update the layer 2 database, otherwise some MRTG and sflow stats may be lost. Related Tools \uf0c1 Port Audit \uf0c1 A new feature (adding in v4.9.0) allows IXP Manager administrators to audit port speeds as configured in physical interfaces against what has been discovered in the last SNMP run. You can run it from Artisan such as the following example: ./artisan audit:port-speeds Audit of Configured Physical Interface Port Speeds Against SNMP Discovered Speeds +------------------------------+----------+----------------+-----------------------+----------+------------+ | Customer | PI DB ID | Switch | Switchport | PI Speed | SNMP Speed | +------------------------------+----------+----------------+-----------------------+----------+------------+ | INEX Route Servers [AS43760] | 14 | swi2-tcy1-2 | GigabitEthernet27 | 0 | 1000 | | INEX [AS2128] | 15 | swi1-ix1-2 | X460-48t Port 47 | 0 | 1000 | | INEX [AS2128] | 16 | swi2-ix1-1 | GigabitEthernet25 | 0 | 1000 | | AS112 Reverse DNS [AS112] | 21 | swi2-nwb1-1 | X670G2-48x-4q Port 15 | 0 | 1000 | | INEX [AS2128] | 357 | swic-cix-2 | GigabitEthernet27 | 100 | 1000 | | AS112 Reverse DNS [AS112] | 590 | swt-cwt1-edge1 | swp3 | 10000 | 1000 | +------------------------------+----------+----------------+-----------------------+----------+------------+ The above examples are edge cases as they are not physically connected devices but rather virtual machines. This audit can be added to cron such that it will only make noise if an issue is found with something like: 13 9 * * * www-data /srv/ixpmanager/artisan audit:port-speeds \\ --cron --ignore-pids 14,15,16,21,357,590","title":"Switches"},{"location":"usage/switches/#switches","text":"The central element of an IXP is the switches.

The IXP Manager Users feature allows you to add and manage users (people who can login to IXP Manager) on a per customer basis including: name / email / phone number username permissions (see below) Types of Users \uf0c1 There are three types of user: Customer User - a standard customer user with read only portal access to a specific customer's dashboard. Customer Administrator - a customer administrative user. This account allows users to make changes as well as manage users for their organisation. Superuser - IXP staff only. FULL ACCESS TO ALL CUSTOMERS AND FUNCTIONS . This is only for your IXP staff! Managing Users \uf0c1 If you are a Superuser, you can manage users in one of two ways: Via the user controller by clicking on Users under IXP CUSTOMER ACTIONS in the left hand menu. This will show all users on the system. For a per customer view, you can click on the Users tab in the standard customer overview page. If you are a customer administrator user, you can manage your own users via the Users menu in the top menu bar. In all cases, you will be given a list of users such as: The available actions include: a documentation link on the top right - that links to this page; to add a new user, click on the [+] button next to the documentation link; the view (eye) icon will show you more information about a specific user; the edit (pencil) icon will allow you to edit users; the delete (trashcan) icon will allow you to delete a user. Adding Users \uf0c1 Since a user can be associated with multiple customers, the new user you wish to add may already exist on the system. For this reason, the first step of adding a user is to just provide and email address: If the user does not exist, you will be invited to complete the rest of the standard details: Note that, as always, the [Help] button will provide context help for each input field. Once you successfully complete the details, the new user will be sent a welcome email ( see below for details ) and invited to set their password. If any users do exist with this email, you will be shown the user's name, username (and, if a superadmin, the other customer(s) the user is associated with). Note that it is possible for an email to be associated with more than one username but this should only happen for legacy users that predate the ability to assign a user to more than one customer. Select the user you wish to add to the customer and set the desired privilege and click [Add User] . The new user will be sent a specific welcome email for users that already exist on the system to let them know they have been added to a new customer account ( see below for details ). Deleting Users \uf0c1 Note that deleting a user results in one of two actions: if the user is only linked to a single customer (probably the most likely case), the user will be fully deleted and removed from the system. if the user is linked to more than one customer, then only the link to this customer will be removed. Users With Multiple Customers \uf0c1 This section explains the handling around users with multiple customers. When logging in, the last customer that the user acted for will be selected. If this customer does not exist / the relationship no longer exists / no previous customer set then a customer will be chosen at random. If a user is associated with more than one customer, then the facility to switch users can be found under the My Account menu on the top right: The current customer is highlighted. Welcome Email \uf0c1 IXP Manager sends a welcome email to all newly created users. The default template for new users this can be found at resources/views/user/emails/welcome.blade.php . When an existing user is associated with an additional customer, the following template is used: resources/views/user/emails/welcome-existing.blade.php . If you wish to change these templates, you can do so via the standard skinning mechanism . Logging in as Another User \uf0c1 Administrative users ( AUTH_SUPERUSER ) can switch to other users to see what they see via the user list or the customer overview page. The purpose of this is for both development and for support staff to replicate issues as reported by users. Planned Work \uf0c1 As IXP Manager v5 evolves, we would like to make a number of changes: look at OAuth2 with links to PeeringDB as well as allowing people to log in / link OAuth supported social media accounts; add 2fa. Passwords and Password Hashing \uf0c1 As of v4.5, all passwords are stored as bcrypt with a cost =10. As of v4.9, administrative users are unable to set a user's password. User's can set (and reset) their passwords via their Profile page or using the password reset functionality.","title":"Users"},{"location":"usage/users/#users","text":"This page refers to IXP Manager = v5.0 User management prior to v5.0 was handled differently - please see this page for the legacy usage.
