            "text": "Requirements\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIXP Manager tries to stay current in terms of technology. Typically, this means some element of framework refresh(es) every couple of years and other more incremental package upgrades with minor version upgrades. As well as the obvious reasons for this, there is also the requirement to prevent developer apathy - insisting on legacy frameworks and packages that have been EOL'd provides a major stumbling block for bringing on new developers and contributors.\n\n\nThe current requirements for the web application are:\n\n\n\n\na Linux / BSD host.\n\n\nMySQL version 5.7 or later.\n\n\nApache / Nginx / etc.\n\n\nPHP \n= 7.0. \nNote that IXP Manager will not run on older versions of PHP.\n\n\nMemcached - optional but highly recommended.\n\n\n\n\nTo complete the installation using the included config/scripts, you will also need to have installed git (\napt-get install git\n) and a number of PHP extensions (see the example \napt-get install\n below).\n\n\nRegrettably the potential combinations of operating systems, versions of\nsame and then versions of PHP are too numerous to provide individual\nsupport. As such, we recommend installing IXP Manager on Ubuntu LTS 16.04 and we officially support this platform.\n\n\nIn fact we provide a complete installation script for this - see \nthe automated installation page\n for details. If you have any issues with the manual installation, the automated script should be your first reference to compare what you are doing to what we recommend.\n\n\nFor completeness, the IXP Manager installation script for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installs:\n\n\napt-get install -qy apache2 php7.0 php7.0-intl php-rrd php7.0-cgi php7.0-cli       \n\\\n\n    php7.0-snmp php7.0-curl php7.0-mcrypt php-memcached libapache2-mod-php7.0      \n\\\n\n    mysql-server mysql-client php7.0-mysql memcached snmp nodejs nodejs-legacy npm \n\\\n\n    php7.0-mbstring php7.0-xml php7.0-gd php7.0-bcmath php-gettext bgpq3           \n\\\n\n    php-memcache unzip php7.0-zip git php-yaml php-ds libconfig-general-perl       \n\\\n\n    libnetaddr-ip-perl mrtg  libconfig-general-perl libnetaddr-ip-perl rrdtool     \n\\\n\n    librrds-perl\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using a different platform, you will need to replicate the above as appropriate for your chosen platform.\n\n\nGet the IXP Manager Source\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe code for IXP Manager is maintained on GitHub and the canonical repository is \ninex/IXP-Manager\n.\n\n\nLog into the server where you wish to install IXP Manager. Move to the directory where you wish to store the source (our examples use \n/srv/ixpmanager\n which we refer to as \n$IXPROOT\n). Note that it \nshould not\n be checked out into any web exposed directory (e.g. do not checkout to \n/var/www\n).\n\n\nIXPROOT\n=\n/srv/ixpmanager\n\ncd\n /srv\ngit clone https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager.git ixpmanager\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n   \n# /srv/ixpmanager\n\ngit checkout master\nchown -R www-data: \n$IXPROOT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Composer and Bower\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIXP Manager uses \nComposer\n to manage its PHP dependencies. First, download a copy of the composer.phar. Once you have the PHAR archive, you can either keep it in your local project directory or move to \n/usr/local/bin\n to use it globally on your system.\n\n\nThe installation script for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installs these via:\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\n\nEXPECTED_SIGNATURE\n=\n$(\nwget https://composer.github.io/installer.sig -O - -q\n)\n\nphp -r \ncopy(\nhttps://getcomposer.org/installer\n, \ncomposer-setup.php\n);\n\n\nACTUAL_SIGNATURE\n=\n$(\nphp -r \necho hash_file(\nSHA384\n, \ncomposer-setup.php\n);\n)\n\n\n\nif\n \n[\n \n$EXPECTED_SIGNATURE\n \n=\n \n$ACTUAL_SIGNATURE\n \n]\n;\n \nthen\n\n    sudo -u www-data bash -c \nHOME=\n$IXPROOT\n \n cd \n$IXPROOT\n \n php composer-setup.php --quiet\n\n    rm \n$IXPROOT\n/composer-setup.php\n\nelse\n\n    \necho\n -e \n\\n\\nERROR: Invalid installer signature for composer installation\n\n    rm \n$IXPROOT\n/composer-setup.php\n    \nexit \n1\n\nfi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand:\n\n\nnpm install -g bower\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Setup and Dependancies\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDependencies\n\uf0c1\n\n\nInstall the required PHP libraries and frontend CSS/JS packages:\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\nphp composer.phar install --no-dev --prefer-dist\nbower install\ncp .env.example .env\nphp artisan key:generate\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Setup\n\uf0c1\n\n\nUse whatever means you like to create a database and user for IXP Manager. For example:\n\n\nCREATE\n \nDATABASE\n \n`ixp`\n \nCHARACTER\n \nSET\n \n=\n \nutf8mb4\n \nCOLLATE\n \n=\n \nutf8mb4_unicode_ci\n;\n\n\nGRANT\n \nALL\n \nON\n \n`ixp`\n.\n*\n \nTO\n \n`ixp`\n@\n`localhost`\n \nIDENTIFIED\n \nBY\n \npick a password!\n;\n\n\nFLUSH\n \nPRIVILEGES\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen edit \n$IXPROOT/.env\n and set the database options:\n\n\nDB_HOST=localhost\nDB_DATABASE=ixp\nDB_USERNAME=ixp\nDB_PASSWORD=password\n\n\n\n\n\nNow create the database schema:\n\n\nphp artisan doctrine:schema:create\n\n\n\n\n\nSome older scripts still rely on MySQL view tables. Create these with:\n\n\nmysql -u ixp -p ixp \n \n$IXPROOT\n/tools/sql/views.sql\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEdit \n$IXPROOT/.env\n and review and set/change all parameters.

            "text": "IXP Manager tries to stay current in terms of technology. Typically, this means some element of framework refresh(es) every couple of years and other more incremental package upgrades with minor version upgrades. As well as the obvious reasons for this, there is also the requirement to prevent developer apathy - insisting on legacy frameworks and packages that have been EOL'd provides a major stumbling block for bringing on new developers and contributors.  The current requirements for the web application are:   a Linux / BSD host.  MySQL version 5.7 or later.  Apache / Nginx / etc.  PHP  = 7.0.  Note that IXP Manager will not run on older versions of PHP.  Memcached - optional but highly recommended.   To complete the installation using the included config/scripts, you will also need to have installed git ( apt-get install git ) and a number of PHP extensions (see the example  apt-get install  below).  Regrettably the potential combinations of operating systems, versions of\nsame and then versions of PHP are too numerous to provide individual\nsupport. As such, we recommend installing IXP Manager on Ubuntu LTS 16.04 and we officially support this platform.  In fact we provide a complete installation script for this - see  the automated installation page  for details. If you have any issues with the manual installation, the automated script should be your first reference to compare what you are doing to what we recommend.  For completeness, the IXP Manager installation script for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installs:  apt-get install -qy apache2 php7.0 php7.0-intl php-rrd php7.0-cgi php7.0-cli        \\ \n    php7.0-snmp php7.0-curl php7.0-mcrypt php-memcached libapache2-mod-php7.0       \\ \n    mysql-server mysql-client php7.0-mysql memcached snmp nodejs nodejs-legacy npm  \\ \n    php7.0-mbstring php7.0-xml php7.0-gd php7.0-bcmath php-gettext bgpq3            \\ \n    php-memcache unzip php7.0-zip git php-yaml php-ds libconfig-general-perl        \\ \n    libnetaddr-ip-perl mrtg  libconfig-general-perl libnetaddr-ip-perl rrdtool      \\ \n    librrds-perl  If you are using a different platform, you will need to replicate the above as appropriate for your chosen platform.",

The advised way to handle this is to install v4 in parallel and then switch over (by adjusting your DNS or Apache configuration for example) to the new v4 directory/server.\n\n\nThis documentation was compiled while performing an upgrade on three separate IXP Manager installations.\n\n\nBefore you proceed, please check the requirements listed in \nthe official installation instructions\n.\n\n\nIf you need help, please \ncontact us via the public mailing list\n.\n\n\nIf you find that this guide is insufficient, please \ncontribute back to this documentation\n.\n\n\nOverview\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe upgrade process is quite involved and, depending how many IXP Manager features you use, may take the best part of a day.\n\n\nThe general steps are:\n\n\n\n\nDuplicate the Database (see below)\n\n\nInstall IXP Manager v4 (see below)\n\n\nInitial configuration tasks (see below), including:\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nUpdate the database schema\n\n\nIf appropriate, migrate plaintext passwords to bcrypt\n\n\nMRTG Graphing Migration (including peer to peer changes) (see below)\n\n\nRoute collector / servers / AS112 configuration has changed - \nsee here\n\n\nDNS / ARPA export has changed - \nsee here\n\n\nExamine the new layer2 addresses feature and consideration migration - \nsee here\n\n\nIf you are using Bird, set up looking glasses - \nsee here\n\n\nSet up you cross connect / patch panel management - \nsee here\n\n\nRead up on \nthe new skinning features\n and see if you need to update / duplicate any skinned files.\n\n\n\n\nYou will note from the above that a number of features have been deprecated in favor of doing it in new ways. Our advice is to keep both v3 and v4 live in parallel and then migrate services piece meal. That way your route server configuration can continue pulling from v3 until you have set-up the v4 method. Just ensure that people do not make customer changes in either IXP Manager during this period (or, if they do, do it in both!).\n\n\nDeprecations / Removed Features\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs of IXP Manager v4 (certainly \n=v4.5), the following are no longer available:\n\n\n\n\nv3 methods for generating route collector. configuration\n - \nsee here for the v4 method\n.\n\n\nv3 methods for generating route server configuration\n - \nsee here for the v4 method\n.\n\n\nv3 methods for generating AS112 BGP configuration\n - \nsee here for the v4 method\n.\n\n\nv3 method for IRRDB updates\n - \nsee here for the v4 method\n.\n\n\nTACACS+ and RADIUS templates - see old details \nhere for TACACS+\n and \nhere for RADIUS\n.\n\n\nv3 method for DNS/ARPA generation\n - \nsee here for the v4 method\n.\n\n\nSupport for plaintext passwords - see below.\n\n\n\n\nDuplicating the Database\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs we're installing in parallel, we want to duplicate the database.\n\n\nWhen granting permissions on the new database, use your existing IXP Manager database credentials for ease of configuration.\n\n\nmysql -u root -pXXX -e \nCREATE DATABASE ixp4 CHARACTER SET = \nutf8mb4\n COLLATE = \nutf8mb4_unicode_ci\n;\n\n\nmysqldump -u root -pXXX ixp \n|\n mysql -u root -pXXX ixp4\n\nmysql -u root -pXXX -e \nGRANT ALL ON ixp4.* TO `ixp`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED BY \nYYY\n;\n\n\n\n# and test:\n\nmysql -u ixp -pYYY -h localhost ixp4\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall IXP Manager\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis is very much a tl;dr version of \nthe official installation instructions\n which you should review if you need additional help.\n\n\nCritically, these upgrade instructions were designed and tested against IXP Manager v4.5.0. You need to upgrade to this version first and then \nfollow the v4 upgrade instructions from there\n.\n\n\nThe code for IXP Manager is maintained on GitHub and the canonical repository is \ninex/IXP-Manager\n.\n\n\nLog into the server where you wish to install IXP Manager and move to the directory where you wish to install (we use \n/srv/ixpmanager\n here as an example and which will be referred to as \n$IXPROOT\n below).\n\n\nNote that it should not be checked out into any web exposed directory (e.g. do not checkout to \n/var/www\n).\n\n\nIXPROOT\n=\n/srv/ixpmanager\n\n\n# get the source / application\n\ngit clone https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager.git \n$IXPROOT\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\ngit checkout v4.5.0\n\n\n# Using https://getcomposer.org/\n\ncomposer.phar install\n\n\n# Using https://bower.io/\n\nbower install\n\n\n# Start with the example configuration and edit.\n\n\n# Read the official documentation for help.\n\n\n# Ensure you configure the database.\n\n\n# More notes on this follow below.\n\ncp .env.example .env\nphp artisan key:generate\njoe .env\n\n\n# File system permissions\n\nchown -R www-data: var/ storage/ bootstrap/cache database/Proxies\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Configuration Tasks\n\uf0c1\n\n\nNew Local Settings / Configuration (Laravel)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIXP Manager v4 uses a new PHP framework (Zend Framework swapped for Laravel). As such, all the older configuration options (from \napplication/configs/application.ini\n) need to be ported to \n.env\n.\n\n\nThe \nphp dotenv\n file (\n.env\n) is where all the new configuration options go. These in turn are used by the configuration files under \nconfig/\n.\n\n\nNB: Where possible, place local changes into \n.env\n rather than changing the config files as these files are under version control. See \nLaravel's documentation on this\n and email the mailing list for help.\n\n\nOnce you have worked your way through \n.env\n, move into the \n$IXPROOT/config\n directory and - as appropriate for your own installation - examine each config file that ends in \n.dist\n. If you use / need any features in these files, copy then such as:\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n/config\ncp xxxx.php.dist xxxx.php\n\n\n\n\n\nThen edit the resultant \n.php\n file (or, better, where \nconfig()\n options exist, add them to \n.env\n).\n\n\nThese \n.dist\n files represent v3 funtionality that has not yet been fully ported to v4/Laravel.\n\n\nUpdate the Database Schema\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere's about 50 schema changed between the end of v3 and v4.4.\n\n\nView the required changes with:\n\n\n./artisan doctrine:schema:update --sql\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd apply with:\n\n\n./artisan doctrine:schema:update --force\n\n\n\n Note that this may take a few minutes if you have a lot of data such as BGP session data.\n\n\nMigrate Plaintext Passwords to Bcrypt\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSince v4.5, we \nno longer allow plaintext passwords\n. If you were using plaintext passwords, you need to convert them to bcrypt as follows:\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\n\n\n# dummy run to see what happens:\n\nphp artisan utils:convert-plaintext-password\n\n\n# really convert passwords and save to database:\n\nphp artisan utils:convert-plaintext-password --force\n\n\n\n\n\nStage One Complete\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou should be able to point Apache / your web server at the new IXP Manager installation and log in.\n\n\nMRTG Graphing Migration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWe've implemented a new graphing backend called \nGrapher\n. One of the changes is that the graphing directory structure and file-naming conventions have changed. Primarily, we've replaced non-static handles (such as database fields like \ncustomer.shortname\n, \nphysicalinterface.monitorindex\n and \nswitcher.name\n with immutable primary keys).\n\n\nAs such, you need to both rename the statistics directory structure and regenerate the configuration.\n\n\nIt is strongly recommended you copy your existing files and do this in parallel or, at least keep a backup.\n Also, stop the MRTG daemon before starting.\n\n\nPerforming the Migration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFirst, you'll need to update your local configuration in \n.env\n by setting something like:\n\n\nGRAPHER_BACKENDS=\nmrtg\n\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_LOGDIR=\n/path/to/new/mrtg/data\n\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_WORKDIR=\n/path/to/new/mrtg/data\n\nGRAPHER_CACHE_ENABLED=true\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the \nGrapher\n documentation for full details of what these mean.\n\n\nYou'll then need to migrate all your MRTG files to the new naming scheme.

This is a full / normal trafficking IXP member.\n\n\nPro-bono\n: like full but for organisations that you provide IXP access to \nfor the good of the internet / your members\n. Examples at INEX include the \nAS112 service\n, \nPacket Clearing House's\n route collector and DNS TLD/root services and other DNS root servers such as the RIPE K root / Verisign, etc.\n\n\nInternal\n: while not enforced, you should really only have two internal customers which is the IXP itself and, separately, the IXP route servers. Connections / interfaces such as route collectors and core links would be associated with the IXP customer. Because route servers typically have a dedicated ASN, they would have their own customer with their interfaces associated here.\n\n\nAssociate\n: INEX has a concept of \nassociate members\n which enables those organisations who are involved in the IP and networking industry, but who do not have their own IP traffic to peer, an opportunity to participate in the extensive INEX community.

Examples at INEX include the  AS112 service ,  Packet Clearing House's  route collector and DNS TLD/root services and other DNS root servers such as the RIPE K root / Verisign, etc.  Internal : while not enforced, you should really only have two internal customers which is the IXP itself and, separately, the IXP route servers. Connections / interfaces such as route collectors and core links would be associated with the IXP customer. Because route servers typically have a dedicated ASN, they would have their own customer with their interfaces associated here.  Associate : INEX has a concept of  associate members  which enables those organisations who are involved in the IP and networking industry, but who do not have their own IP traffic to peer, an opportunity to participate in the extensive INEX community.

            "text": "Customer Interfaces\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis section explains how to set up a customer interface.\n\n\nDatabase Overview\n\uf0c1\n\n\nTo fully understand how IXP Manager treats customer interfaces, you need a little background on the database schema. This will also help explain why we have laid out the UI as it is.\n\n\nThe original database schema dates from pre-2005 and has stood the test of time extremely well.\n\n\n\n\nThe above is described as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCustomers have a 1:n relationship with virtual interfaces (VI). A VI is a container object that represents a customer connection and all the elements that make up that connection.\n\n\nVIs have a 1:n relationship with physical interfaces (PI).\n\n\nA physical interface in turn has a 1:1 relationship with switch ports (SP).\n\n\nPIs represent what we say the customer has (e.g. a 1Gb port). The SP has information from the switch itself and can help identify inconsistencies with what was expected to be configured/billed and what has actually been provisioned).\n\n\nPIs can also move between SPs (e.g. customer upgrades / switch replacements / etc.).\n\n\nBy schematically representing PIs and SPs as different entities, we can associate elements such as usage graphs to the PI so these remain consistent when a SP changes.\n\n\nAdding a second (or more) PI to a VI indicates that the port is a LAG.\n\n\nVIs have a 1:n relationship with VLAN interfaces (VLI). You can consider the PI element the layer2 / physical element and the VLI element the layer3 element.\n\n\nA VLI has a 1:1 mapping with a VLAN (typically the peering LAN).\n\n\nIf IPv4 is enabled, the VLI has a 1:1 mapping to an IPv4 address from the given VLAN.\n\n\nIf IPv6 is enabled, the VLI has a 1:1 mapping to an IPv6 address from the given VLAN.\n\n\nThe VLI also indicates if this interface should have a route server peering session, MD5 passwords, etc. (all explained below).\n\n\n\n\nProvisioning an Interface via the Wizard\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe best way to provision a new interface for a customer is to use the wizard. This can be accessed from the customer's overview page via a menu on the top right:\n\n\n\n\nWhen you open the wizard, you will see:\n\n\n\n\nThis can be used to provision a single port standard customer connection. If they customer needs a LAG or other non-standard options, these can be added afterwards.\n\n\nGeneral Interface Settings\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe customer should be prefilled and read-only as you enter the wizard from a specific customer overview page.\n\n\nYou would normally just select your main / primary peering VLAN from the \nVLAN\n dropdown. There are some notable exceptions:\n\n\n\n\nyou may have more than one peering LAN. For example, INEX runs two resilient peering networks in Dublin and a separate regional exchange called INEX Cork. These are all unique VLANs.\n\n\nif you are provisioning a port dedicated to a private VLAN, you would just select that VLAN but leave \nIPv4 Enabled\n and \nIPv6 Enabled\n unchecked as IP addressing on private VLANs in not within an IX's purview.\n\n\nat INEX we also have quarantine VLANs for each peering VLAN. You would \ntypically\n not select a quarantine VLAN here during provisioning unless you are using automation. Just put the interface in the primary peering LAN and let the \nPhysical Interface Settings\n (see below) look after the quarantine flag.\n\n\nYou should check the \nUse 802.1q framing\n checkbox if the port should be tagged facing the customer. If you are not using any automation tools, this will be informational for you rather than production affecting.\n\n\nChecking either or both of \nIPv4 Enabled\n and \nIPv6 Enabled\n will show the \nIPv4 Details\n and \nIPv6 Details\n (as per the above image) and enable these protocols for the customer's connection.\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Interface Settings\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis section allows you to select the physical interface / switch port for the connection.\n\n\n\n\nSwitch\n: a dropdown list of all switches. Be careful as at present this list is all active switches rather than switches on the same infrastructure as the selected VLAN from \nGeneral Interface Settings\n.\n\n\nPort\n: the switch port to use. This is dynamically populated when the switch is selected and \nwill only show ports of type \nPeering\n or type \nUnset / Unknown\n (these are set on a per port basis when adding / editing switches).\n\n\n\n\nStatus\n: the port status currently has one of five options. They effectively work as a boolean where \nConnected\n means on/enabled and the rest mean disabled as explained below. In practice, we tend to just use three states:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnected\n: this is the most important. When a \nvirtual interface\n has \nany\n port with the \nConnected\n state, then IXP Manager will consider this connection active and will generate router configuration, monitoring configuration, etc.\n\n\n\n\nAwaiting X-Connect\n: the customer has requested an upgrade / new port and we are awaiting for the co-location provider / customer to get the cross connect organised.\n\n\nQuarantine\n: the port is connected and is under going quarantine prior to being moved onto the production peering LAN. During quarantine, INEX checks the port to ensure only ARP, IPv4 and IPv6 packets are received (no *-discovery, STP, etc. as well as a number of other things).\n\n\n\n\nThe \nNot Connected\n and \nDisabled\n states have the same effect as (2) and (3) above and can be used as informational settings where (2) and (3) do not apply.\n\n\nSpeed and duplex are self explanatory. These settings in the \nphysical interface\n entity are informational unless you are doing automation. They also have knock on effects to (for example) graphing - where the MRTG max value on an interface is set to this to prevent weird excessive spikes on counter rollovers.\n\n\nGeneral VLAN Settings\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThese settings apply to the VLAN interface.\n\n\nThe \nMax BGP Prefixes\n is a setting used to determine max prefixes on router BGP peers - please \nsee the global version of this as explained in the customer section for details\n.\n\n\nIf \nApply IRRDB Filtering\n is \nnot\n set, then the route servers will accept any prefixes advertised by the customer (note that the default templates will filter martians and apply a max prefix limit). Generally speaking this is a \nvery bad idea\n and should only be used in exceptional cases. \nINEX never uses this setting - but demand from other IX's had it added.\n\n\nMulticast Enabled\n is informational only. INEX used to support multicast on the peering LAN but removed support in 2015 due to lack of interest and added complexity / cost when purchasing new switches.\n\n\nIf \nRoute Server Client\n is checked, then IXP Manager will configure a BGP peer for this connection when generating \nroute server configurations\n. It is also used in other areas to show if a member uses the route servers or not, by the \nPeering Manager\n to calculate missing BGP sessions, etc.\n\n\nSimilarly, if \nAS112 Client\n is checked, then IXP Manager will configure a BGP peer for this connection when generating \nAS112 router configurations\n.\n\n\nIPv4/IPv6 Details\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWhen \nIPv4 / IPv6 Enabled\n is checked under \nGeneral Interface Settings\n above, these two sections will be available.\n\n\nThe same details apply to IPv4 and IPv6 options so we will document them together.\n\n\n\n\nIP Address\n: the IP address to assign to this customer. This is taken from \navailable\n IP addresses for the VLAN selected in \nGeneral Interface Settings\n.\n\n\nIP addresses are added in IXP Manager via the left hand menu under IXP Admin Actions.\n\n\nThe dropdown also works as an input field - this allows you to enter a new IP address that does not already exist in the field. When the wizard form is submitted, the address is added and associated with the VLAN. This is most useful for the IPv6 field if you are using a non-sequential numbering plan.\n\n\nHostname\n: if you use IXP Manager to configure your \nDNS ARPA\n entries, the hostname entered here will be returned when a PTR request is made for the assigned IP address. Enter a complete hostname without trailing period such as: \nwww.example.com\n.\n\n\nBGP MD5 Secret\n: The will be used for \ngenerating router configurations\n.\n\n\nThe \ncircle refresh\n icon in the IPv4 section will generate a cryptographically secure secret in modern browsers.\n\n\nThe \nsquare refresh\n icon in the IPv6 section will copy the value from the IPv4 section.\n\n\nNote that setting a MD5 here does not mean that all router configurations have to include it. MD5 can be disabled entirely by a \nrouters configuration\n or by templating.\n\n\nCan Ping\n: IXP Manager generates configuration for a number of other tools such as \nSmokeping\n and Nagios which ping customer routers. These are invaluable tools for problem solving, monitoring and graphing long term trends. We enable this by default unless a customer specifically asks us not to.\n\n\nCan Monitor RC BGP\n: this is more of a legacy option for configuration builders that used to check for established route collector BGP sessions and warn if not present. This is deprecated and will be removed.\n\n\n\n\nViewing / Editing an Interface\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOnce an interface has been added as per the above wizard instructions, you can view and edit the interface by selecting the edit icon against the connection you are interested in from the \nPorts\n tab on the customer overview page. When you do that, you will see a screen such as the following:\n\n\n\n\nYou can see from the layout of this screen how it ties in with the schema explained above.\n\n\nVirtual Interface Details\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe screenshot above shows the virtual interface details with the \nAdvanced Options\n shown. The additional fields here that were not in the wizard are described below.\n\n\nLink aggregation / LAG framing\n is mostly informational unless you are doing automation. There are some restrictions. Namely / specifically:\n\n\n\n\nif you have more than one physical interface, it will require you to set this.\n\n\nfor a single interface, checking this indicates you want LACP on a single member LAG. This is useful and often common practice as it allows upgrades without outages.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nVirtual Interface Name\n is again mostly informational unless you are doing automation. It should be the start of the LAG name without the number. On an IOS device this would be \nPort-channel\n for example. Matched with this is the \nChannel Group Number\n with is tacked onto the end of the \nVirtual Interface Name\n. Leave it as 0 and when you check \nLink aggregation / LAG framing\n and save the changes, IXP Manager will set this to the next available unused port channel / bundle / LAG number on that switch.\n\n\nBoth \nDescription\n and \nMTU\n are informational.\n\n\nPhysical Interfaces\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou can add additional physical interfaces to a connection / virtual interface. This effectivily means you are creating a LAG. The form for adding additional physical interfaces is indentical to that in the wizard.\n\n\nVLAN Interfaces\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe most common use case of more than one VLAN Interface is when your customer may also have private VLANs on their connection.\n\n\nOther than that, the VLAN interface add / edit form has all the same elements as the wizard with one addition:\n\n\n\n\nBusy host\n: this flag indicates that the customer's router is unusually slow to reply to ICMP echo requests and that when monitoring, the configuraiton should allow for warnings after a 5sec RTT rather than 1sec.",

Where SNMP is available, the above SNMP version of this has more features and is preferred.\n\n\nPort MAU Detail:\n MAU (Medium Attachment Units) - provides information on the XFP / SFP / etc. optics installed in a switch. If the option is disabled then it means the switch does not support the SNMP MAU MIB.\n\n\nPort Report:\n a simple report listing who is connected to each port in a switch. E.g. useful as a hardcopy when going to a datacentre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding and Editing Switches\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFrom the \nlist view described above\n, click the \nplus\n button in the top right to add a switch. Switches are added by SNMP poll so the first step is to provide a hostname and SNMP v2 community:\n\n\n\n\nThe switch must respond to SNMP queries from the server on which IXP Manager is installed. This can be testing on the command line as follows:\n\n\nroot@ixpmanager:~# snmpget -c yourcommunity -v 2c switch01.mgmt.example.com .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0\niso.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 \n=\n STRING: \nArista Networks EOS version 4.18.0F running on an Arista Networks DCS-7280SR-48C6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter completing the details and clicking \nNext \n, IXP Manager will poll the switch and present you with the second (and last) stage in adding a switch:\n\n\n\n\nThe important things to note about this are:\n\n\n\n\nClicking the green \nHelp\n button will show individual help / instructions for each field.\n\n\nThe hostname and SNMP community are read only here as they were entered in the previous step and the additional details pre-filled were discovered by a SNMP poll.\n\n\nThe name of the switch is how you want it shown in various sections of IXP Manager. We recommend using the hostname of the fully-qualified-domain-name of the switch. Regardless of what you use, please do not use periods, spaces or non-alphanumeric characters besides dashes and underscores.\n\n\nThe vendor and model are prefilled where IXP Manager could successfully identify them based on \nplatform discovery - see below\n. If the vendor does not exist in the dropdown, it can be added via the \nVendors\n option in the left-hand menu.\n\n\nThe elements under \nManagement Configuration\n are not used directly by IXP Manager but can be used for orchestration and automated provisioning (as it used by INEX - \nsee here\n).\n\n\nThe elements under \nLayer 3 Configuration\n are not used directly by IXP Manager but can be used for orchestration and automated provisioning of overlay networks such as VXLAN (as it used by INEX - \nsee here\n).\n\n\n\n\nPlatform Discovery\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe discovery of a switches vendor, model, operating system details and serial number - as well as MAU details - is achieved via a third party package called \nOSS_SNMP\n. While this shares an author in common with IXP Manager, it is a separate project.\n\n\nIf your switch is not discovered automatically, you can open a ticket \nwith the OSS_SNMP project \ndirectly\n and ensure you \nprovide the details requested here\n.\n\n\nManaging Switch Ports\n\uf0c1\n\n\nRecall the per row / per switch options on the right hand side of each switch's row when listing switches:\n\n\n\n\nThese options allow you to list and manage switch ports. Of these, the most relevant is the \nView / Edit Ports\n under \nSNMP Actions\n which leads to a page as follows:\n\n\n\n\nThe page allows you to:\n\n\n\n\nChange the port type dynamically via AJAX on a per port basis (the column of \nUnset / Unknown\n dropdowns).\n\n\nSelect a group of ports (and optionally invert the selection via the \nsquare refresh\n icon) or select all ports. Then, with the selected ports:\n\n\ndelete them\n\n\nchange their type\n\n\nset them as active / inactive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that deleting ports is not a permanent action if the port physically exists and is discovered in a subsequent SNMP poll.\n\n\nSwitch Port Types\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWhile some of these are clear from the name, we will explain each type here for completeness:\n\n\n\n\nUnset / Unknown:\n no type has been set. A port is automatically set to \nPeering\n or \nCore\n when it is assigned to a customer / core bundle.\n\n\nPeering:\n peering port assigned to a customer. Automatically set when the port is assigned to a customer.\n\n\nMonitor:\n a port used for monitoring / mirroring traffic from another port. These ports are used by INEX when provisioning a new customer during what we call our \nquarantine process\n. This allows us to ensure the customer end is configured correctly without discovery protocols (CDP, LLDP, etc.), keepalives, no unexpected tagged packets, etc.\n\n\nCore:\n a core / inter-switch link port. This is automatically set when a port is added to a core bundle.\n\n\nOther:\n a purpose other than what we have provided options for.\n\n\nManagement:\n management access to a switch.\n\n\nFanout\n and \nReseller\n: used for \nreseller functionality\n.\n\n\n\n\nAutomated Polling / SNMP Updates\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSwicth and switch port information in the database can go stale very quickly. As such, IXP Manager will poll switches using SNMP routinely. This needs to be set-up using an hourly crob job such as the following:\n\n\n10 * * * *    www-data    /srv/ixpmanager/artisan switch:snmp-poll -q\n\n\n\n\n\nThe command signature is:\n\n\nswitch:snmp-poll [--log] [--noflush] [-q, --quiet] [\nswitch\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\n[-q, --quiet]\n does not output anything unless there is an error. Should be used for cron jobs.\n\n\n[--log]\n outputs detailed SNMP polling information to \n/srv/ixpmanager/storage/logs/laravel.log\n. You can tail this file when running it to help diagnose any issues.\n\n\n[--noflush]\n polls the switch but does not write anything to the database.\n\n\n[\nswitch\n]\n allows you to optionally limit the polling to a single named switch (the switch's name, not hostname). If not specified, all switches are polled.\n\n\n\n\nNot that inactive switches are not polled unless an inactive switch name is explicitly specified.\n\n\nMigrating Customers to a New Switch\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWhen moving IXP customers from one switch to another, add the new switch into the IXP Manager as described above. The customer port assignments can easily be changed to the new switch using the IXP Manager web interface. It is advisable not to delete the old port assignment and create a new one, because if this happens, then the old customer port graphs will not be preserved.\n\n\nThe process is, for each customer:\n\n\n\n\nfind the customer's overview page on IXP Manager (chose customer from top right dropdown)\n\n\nfind and edit the relevant port under the \nPorts\n\n\nedit the physical interface of each port being moved\n\n\nchose the new switch and switch port\n\n\nsave the changes\n\n\n\n\nWhen the switch port updates have been completed, it's advisable to rebuild the mrtg configuration using the CLI tool and (if using dynamically discovered MAC addresses) also to update the layer 2 database, otherwise some MRTG and sflow stats may be lost.\n\n\nRelated Tools\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPort Audit\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA new feature (adding in v4.9.0) allows \nIXP Manager\n administrators to audit port speeds as configured in \nphysical interfaces\n against what has been discovered in the last SNMP run.\n\n\nYou can run it from Artisan such as the following example:\n\n\n./artisan audit:port-speeds\n\nAudit of Configured Physical Interface Port Speeds Against SNMP Discovered Speeds\n\n+------------------------------+----------+----------------+-----------------------+----------+------------+\n| Customer                     | PI DB ID | Switch         | Switchport            | PI Speed | SNMP Speed |\n+------------------------------+----------+----------------+-----------------------+----------+------------+\n| INEX Route Servers [AS43760] | 14       | swi2-tcy1-2    | GigabitEthernet27     | 0        | 1000       |\n| INEX [AS2128]                | 15       | swi1-ix1-2     | X460-48t Port 47      | 0        | 1000       |\n| INEX [AS2128]                | 16       | swi2-ix1-1     | GigabitEthernet25     | 0        | 1000       |\n| AS112 Reverse DNS [AS112]    | 21       | swi2-nwb1-1    | X670G2-48x-4q Port 15 | 0        | 1000       |\n| INEX [AS2128]                | 357      | swic-cix-2     | GigabitEthernet27     | 100      | 1000       |\n| AS112 Reverse DNS [AS112]    | 590      | swt-cwt1-edge1 | swp3                  | 10000    | 1000       |\n+------------------------------+----------+----------------+-----------------------+----------+------------+\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above examples are edge cases as they are not physically connected devices but rather virtual machines. This audit can be added to cron such that it will only make noise if an issue is found with something like:\n\n\n13 9 * * *   www-data     /srv/ixpmanager/artisan audit:port-speeds \\\n                            --cron --ignore-pids 14,15,16,21,357,590",

            "text": "Patch Panels / Cross Connects\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOne of the more difficult things for an IXP to manage is the sheer volume of patch panels / cross connects they need to manage. We have approached the issue a number of times in IXP Manger but abandoned the attempt every time. Typically our original solutions were over-engineered where all we really needed was something which could replace a spreadsheet per panel.\n\n\nWe believe we have now developed a feature complete and useful means of managing patch panels and associated cross connects.\n\n\nFeatures\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nAdd / edit patch panels  (which includes cable and connector types).\n\n\nList associated patch panel ports which includes:\n\n\ntheir state (such as available / prewired, awaiting cross connect, connected, awaiting cease, reserved, broken).\n\n\nassociated customer and/or switchport.\n\n\nco-location provider's circuit reference.\n\n\ninternal ticket references.\n\n\nTransition ports from available / prewired to awaiting x-connect to connected to awaiting cease to ceased and then available again.\n\n\nCustomer view of their cross connects.\n\n\nPublic (visible to customers) and private notes per cross connect.\n\n\nAttach public and private files to cross connects (such as test results, completion documents, order forms, etc).\n\n\nMaintain complete history of a patch panel port.\n\n\nGenerate and email LoAs (as PDF) with a URL verification function for co-location providers.\n\n\nGenerate emails for connection and cease requests as well as an email providing full customer view of a cross connect.\n\n\nTypically fibre ports are \nduplex\n ports but there is a growing use of BiDi optics meaning simplex ports. Our implementation treats all ports as simplex but you can mark it as duplex and set its partner port.\n\n\n\n\nDuplex Fibre Ports\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWe suggest adding fibre ports as two ports per duplex port. I.e. if your patch panel has 12 duplex ports, enter this as 24 ports. When allocating ports later, you can set it as a duplex port and select its \npartner / slave port\n. This will future proof your patch panels for the growing use of bidi optics and other simplex based xWDM fibre solutions.\n\n\nFrom our experience, duplex fibre ports are often identified as their individual strands. For example, \nduplex port 5\n would be referenced as \nF9/F10\n.\n\n\nYour mileage may vary on this but we need to allow this flexibility to cover both use-cases. You always have options however:\n\n\n\n\nyou can change the presentation of how these ports are referenced externally by \nskinning\n the templates.\n\n\nyou have the option to edit emails before they are sent to also present this as you wish.\n\n\nyou can chose to treat duplex ports as single ports rather than doubling them up.\n\n\nwhen you have duplex ports on a patch panel, IXP Manager will provide a duplex view by default with a CSS-based toggle to reveal the typical partner ports.\n\n\nif you think IXP Manager can make this easier, please talk to us. \nBut we cannot cover every use case programatically. We've opted to allow flexibility rather than dictate a particular format.\n\n\n\n\nAdding a Patch Panel\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe following image shows a typical \nadd a new patch panel\n form (as of v4.3). You'll note that clicking \nHelp\n provides detailed context aware help messages.\n\n\n\n\nMost of this is self-explanatory but:\n\n\n\n\nBy default, we set the \nColocation Reference\n to the \nPatch Panel Name\n. We are not sure it's a good idea for IXPs to create a second name different to the co-location provider's but this option is available to you. \nSeriously, think about what you are doing here - more references means more confusion!\n The cabinet and cable type is displayed in the list of patch panels so even with obscure data centre references, it should be easy to find what you need.\n\n\nLocation Notes\n: Data centre / co-location providers do a lot of weird, wonderful and strange things! They provide multiple references for a single patch panel (IXP cabinet, MMR, etc.), they get taken over and re-reference everything or even provide no discernable reference. The field is a freetext field that will be included (and parsed as Markdown) in all emails generated by IXP Manager to help you help them identify a patch panel!\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to that, we will also use a cabinets \nU's are counted from top/bottom\n, and a patch panel's \nU position\n and \nmounted at front/rear\n to also create a location description.\n\n When setting the \nNumber of Ports\n, ensure you count duplex fibre ports as \ntwo ports\n. So 12 duplex fibre ports would be entered as 24. When editing a patch panel, this input field represents the number of additional ports you want to add to a patch panel and thus defaults to 0 in that situation.\n\n \nPort Name Prefix\n: This is an optional field intended for use on fibre patch panels. As an example, you may wish to prefix individual fibre strands in a duplex port with F which would mean the name of a duplex port would be displayed as F1/F2.\n* \nChargeable\n: Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. Setting this only sets the default option when allocating ports to members later. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other.\n\n\nFiltering Patch Panel Ports\n\uf0c1\n\n\nQuite often, all you are looking for is a free in a particular location (data centre) or cabinet of a particular cable type (UTP / SMF / etc.).\n\n\nIXP Manager makes this easy from the \nPatch Panels\n page via the top right button labeled \nFilter Options\n. When clicked, this yields an advanced search as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCabinets auto-fills when you chose (or change) a location.\n\n\nPatch Panel Port States\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA patch panel port can have the following states:\n\n\n\n\nAvailable\n: The port is free and available for use.\n\n\nPrewired\n: This is equivalent to available but it means the port is prewired to a given switchport (you set the port when setting the prewired status). This is useful for IXPs that prewire a bunch of ports to avoid remote hands costs / data centre visits.\n\n\nAwaiting Xconnect\n: Port has been assigned to a member and we are awaiting the co-location provider to install the cross connect. In this state, context aware actions such as emailing connection requests, LoA generation and \nSet Connected\n are all available.\n\n\nConnected\n: Connected and in use.\n\n\nAwaiting Cease\n: This connection is no longer required and we are awaiting the end user / co-location provider to cease the connection.\n\n\nCeased\n: You will never see a ceased state. When a cross connect is marked as ceased, it's current state is archived (for history, include files) and the port is reset to \nAvailable\n. We do not revert to \nPrewired\n but an information message is shown to the user to hint this.\n\n\nReserved\n: Useful to mark particular ports as \noff limits\n for whatever reason.\n\n\nBroken\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\nFree / Available Ports\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIXP Manager will colour ports in the \nAvailable\n, \nPrewired\n and \nAwaiting Cease\n states are green allowing an easy visual indication of available ports.\n\n\nPatch Panel Port Lifecycle\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPatch panel ports start as either \navailable\n or \nprewired\n. The context menu in these states is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnset Prewired\n is available as this port has a \nPrewired\n status. Clicking this reverts it to plain \nAvailable\n and disassociates it from the prewired port.\n\n\nEdit Note...\n is always available and provides a pop up to edit public and private notes associated with the port (current lifecycle - ceased ports have their notes at that time archived and cleared).\n\n\n\n\nThe main lifecycle option here is \nAllocate\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n: A one line short description to be shown in the list of patch panel ports. Just enough to help explain the ports purpose. Detailed information should be placed in the notes section. Can also be used to explain a reserved / broken / other port. Note that this is parsed as Markdown. \nNB:\n A description is discouraged for customer ports connected to a switch. The customer name and switch port are the description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColocation Circuit Reference\n: this is the reference provided by the colocation provider to uniquely reference this cross connect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTicket Reference(s)\n: This is a free text field to be used by IXPs as they wish. The intended use is to enter helpdesk ticket references that relate to this cross connect order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuplex connection?\n: Clicking this allows you to select the slave port for duplex connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch / Switch Port\n / \nCustomer\n: You have a number of options when allocating a port:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the port is pre-wired then the switch / switch port will be set here.\n\n\n\n\nIf you chose a switch port which has been allocated to a customer, then this patch panel port will also be allocated to that customer. The backend logic will detect if this is the case and update the customer field.\n\n\nConversely, if you chose a customer first, the switch / switch port dropdowns will be populated with only that customer's assigned ports.\n\n\nSometimes you will get cross connects that are not intended to be connected to peering switches (e.g. connections to co-located customer equipment, IXP metro connections, etc.). In these cases, just select the customer (and if it's the IXP itself, select the IXP customer) and leave switch / switch port unselected.\n\n\n\n\nIf you need to reset these fields, just click either of the Reset button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatch Panel Port Status\n: when allocating a port, this will allow you to set the state to \nAwaiting Xconnect\n or \nConnected\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Interface Status\n: this is not depicted above. If the selected switch port has already been assigned to a customer by way of a physical interface, you will have the option to update this here also.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic\n and \nPrivate Notes\n: Public notes are available to the customer. Both fields are interpreted as Markdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChargeable\n: Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other. How individual IXPs use this is up to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Use\n: Marks the port as used by the IXP itself. E.g. metro connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwned By\n: Useful indication for billing and cease requests. Should represent the contractural owner of the cross connect. One of: Customer, IXP, Service Provider, Data Centre, Other. \nService Provider\n might be a metro provider where they ordered the cross connect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce a port is allocated, it enters the \nAwaiting XConnect\n / \nConnected\n state and there are additional context menu options available:\n\n\n\n\nThe three lifecycle actions are:\n\n\n\n\nSet Connected\n: updates the status (and allows you to add public/private notes). You next action after this should be \nEmail - Connect\n.\n\n\nSet Awaiting Cease\n: mark the port and pending disconnection. Your next action after this should be \nEmail - Cease\n.\n\n\nSet Ceased\n: this is a \ntransitive state\n in that it doesn't \nstick\n. When you mark a patch panel as ceased, the existing details (including files and notes) are archived as part of the port's history and then port is then cleared and made available again.\n\n\n\n\nFile Attachments\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOver the lifetime of a cross connect - and particularly when it is being ordered, there may be files exchanges between you and your customers or the colocation provider. These can be added to the patch panel port via the \nAttach File...\n option.\n\n\nThe dialog will dynamically determine the maximum file upload size based on your PHP settings. To alter this, change the following in your server's appropriate \nphp.ini\n:\n\n\n; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.\nupload_max_filesize = 40M\n\n; Must be greater than or equal to upload_max_filesize\npost_max_size = 40M\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease search the internet for further help as this is outside the scope of IXP Manager documentation.\n\n\nThe following features apply to file attachments:\n\n\n\n\nthey are archived along with the port history when a cross connect is ceased.\n\n\nthey are stored under \n$IXPROOT/storage/files/ppp\n.\n\n\ntwo files of the same name cannot be uploaded for a single patch panel port.\n\n\nthey can be marked as public or private:\n\n\npublic files are accessible to the customer through their own dashboard.\n\n\npublic files are attached to the \nEmail - Information\n email.\n\n\n\n\nLoA Generation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nMany co-location providers will not accept a cross connect order without a LoA \n(Letter of Agency/Authority)\n from the party to whom the cross connect is to be delivered (typically the IXP).\n\n\nIXP Manager will generate a PDF LoA to download or include in the emails it generates for you. Here is an example:\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to \nskin\n this yourself to change the legalese, address and contact details and potentially add a logo. See the version INEX uses \nhere\n (which includes and embedded PNG logo).\n\n\nNote that \nDompdf\n is used to turn the HTML template into a PDF and it has some restrictions.\n\n\nYou have two options for generating LoAs (without having IXP Manager email them):\n\n\n\n\nDownload PDF\n: downloads the PDF via your browser.\n\n\nView PDF\n: displays the PDF LoA in your browser (where browser supports it).\n\n\n\n\nLoA Verification\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe stock LoA template (and INEX's version) includes a link that allows co-location browsers to click on to verify its veracity.\n\n\nOn successful verification, the end user sees:\n\n\n\n\nEmail Generation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIXP Manager allows you to send four emails related to patch panels / cross connects (port status dependent). These are listed below. The Email editor looks as follows:\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\n\n\n\nthe option to attach a PDF LoA is a checkbox.\n\n\nthe email is written in Markdown with a preview available. The email is sent as both HTML (from the Markdown) and the plaintext version.\n\n\n\n\nThe four email templates available are:\n\n\n\n\nEmail - Connect\n: Email the customer a request to order a cross connect to the given demarcation points. A LoA is attached as a PDF by default unless you uncheck the box in the email editor.\n\n\nEmail - Cease\n: Email the customer a request to cease a cross connect.\n\n\nEmail - Information\n: Email the customer all details on file about a cross connect. We often get requests for this at INEX and this simplifies the process. The generated email includes:\n\n\nthe standard details regarding port and co-location reference;\n\n\npublic notes;\n\n\npublic files as attachments.\n\n\nEmail - LoA\n: Email a LoA to the customer as attached as a PDF. This is similar to \nEmail - Connect\n but it is more reflective of a typical response to a second request for a LoA.\n\n\n\n\nAll email templates can be \nskinned\n for your own needs. See INEX's example skins \nhere\n.\n\n\nViewing Patch Panel Details and Archives\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEach patch panel port row has the following button:\n\n\n\n\nThe number in the badge indicates how many historical records are available.\n\n\nClicking on the button yields the following view screen:\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment History\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Patch Panels functionality was developed during Q1 2017 and added in March 2017.

Data that has the best chance of being correct and up to date.\n\n\nTo find out more about the JSON schema and see examples, you can \nread more here\n, \nexplore many of the public IXP end points available here\n or see the GitHub \neuro-ix/json-schemas\n repository.\n\n\nIXP Manager\n supports the IX-F Member List Export out of the box. It previously supported all versions from 0.3 to 0.5 but as of May 2017, we now only support 0.6 and 0.7. This is because these have become the stable common versions (as at time of writing, November 2018).\n\n\nSometimes you may need something more customized than the the IX-F Member Export. For that, see \nthe other member export feature\n if IXP Manager.\n\n\nPreparing the IX-F Member Export\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere are a small number of things you should do to ensure your IX-F export is correct.\n\n\nCorrectly set the PeeringDB ID and IX-F ID\n\n\nThe first is to ensure you have correctly set the PeeringDB ID and IX-F ID in your infrastructure (see \nInfrastructures\n under the left hand side \nIXP ADMIN ACTIONS\n menu).\n\n\nThe IX-F ID is mandatory. You will find yours by searching \nthe IX-F providers database here\n. If you are a new IXP that is not registered here, please email your IXP's: full name, short name, city / region / country, GPS co-ordinates and website URL to \nsecretariat (at) euro-ix (dot) net\n so they can register it in the IXPDB.\n\n\nCreate Network Info\n\n\nThe second bit is a little hacky and we apologize for this.

Data that has the best chance of being correct and up to date.  To find out more about the JSON schema and see examples, you can  read more here ,  explore many of the public IXP end points available here  or see the GitHub  euro-ix/json-schemas  repository.  IXP Manager  supports the IX-F Member List Export out of the box. It previously supported all versions from 0.3 to 0.5 but as of May 2017, we now only support 0.6 and 0.7. This is because these have become the stable common versions (as at time of writing, November 2018).  Sometimes you may need something more customized than the the IX-F Member Export.

Correctly set the PeeringDB ID and IX-F ID  The first is to ensure you have correctly set the PeeringDB ID and IX-F ID in your infrastructure (see  Infrastructures  under the left hand side  IXP ADMIN ACTIONS  menu).  The IX-F ID is mandatory. You will find yours by searching  the IX-F providers database here . If you are a new IXP that is not registered here, please email your IXP's: full name, short name, city / region / country, GPS co-ordinates and website URL to  secretariat (at) euro-ix (dot) net  so they can register it in the IXPDB.  Create Network Info  The second bit is a little hacky and we apologize for this. We are working to put a more appropriate UI (and database schema) around this in a future version. There is a database table called  networkinfo  that requires you to manually insert some detail on your peering LAN.  The first thing you need is the peering VLAN ID.  [clarification note: this is nothing to do with PeeringDB but the VLAN created within IXP Manager].  For this, select  VLANs  under the left hand side  IXP ADMIN ACTIONS  menu in IXP Manager. Locate your peering VLAN  DB ID  and note it.  For our example, we will use the following sample data:   Peering VLAN  DB ID : 66  IPv4 peering network:  192.0.2.0/25  with route servers on  .8  and  .9  IPv6 peering network:  2001:db8:1000::/64  with route servers on  .8  and  .9   You need need to add this data to  networkinfo  with the following sample SQL commands:  INSERT   INTO   `networkinfo` \n     (   `vlanid` ,   `protocol` ,   `network` ,   `masklen` ,   `rs1address` ,   `rs2address` ),  VALUES \n     (   66 ,   4 ,   192.0.2.0 ,   25 ,   192.0.2.8 ,   192.0.2.9   );  INSERT   INTO   `networkinfo` \n     (   `vlanid` ,   `protocol` ,   `network` ,   `masklen` ,   `rs1address` ,   `rs2address` ),  VALUES \n     (   66 ,   6 ,   2001:db8:1000:: ,   64 ,   2001:db8:1000::8 ,   2001:db8:1000::9   );   Set Your IXP's Name / Country / etc  The third task is to ensure your IXP's details are correct in the IX-F export.  You will most likely have nothing to do here as it would have been done on installation but this reference may prove useful if there are any issues.  These are mostly set in the  .env  file (as well as some other places) and the following table shows how they get mapped to the IX-F Export:     IX-F Export IXP Element  How to Set in IXP Manager      shortname  In IXP Manager, from the  Infrastructure  object name field    name  IDENTITY_LEGALNAME  from  .env    country  IDENTITY_COUNTRY  from  .env   in 2-letter ISO2 format    url  IDENTITY_CORPORATE_URL  from  .env    peeringdb_id  In IXP Manager, from the  Infrastructure  object    ixf_id  In IXP Manager, from the  Infrastructure  object    support_email  IDENTITY_SUPPORT_EMAIL  from  .env    support_phone  IDENTITY_SUPPORT_PHONE  from  .env    support_contact_hours  IDENTITY_SUPPORT_HOURS  from  .env    emergency_email  IDENTITY_SUPPORT_EMAIL  from  .env    emergency_phone  IDENTITY_SUPPORT_PHONE  from  .env    emergency_contact_hours  IDENTITY_SUPPORT_HOURS  from  .env    billing_email  IDENTITY_BILLING_EMAIL    billing_phone  IDENTITY_BILLING_PHONE    billing_contact_hours  IDENTITY_BILLING_HOURS     We we say  from the Infrastructure object  above, we mean that when you are logged into IXP Manager as an admin, it's the  Infrastructures  menu option under  IXP Admin Actions  on the left hand side.",

Any mailing list members that are added separately without a matching user in IXP Manager are not interfered with.\n\n\nConfiguring Available Mailing Lists\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere is a sample configuration file which you need to copy as follows:\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\ncp config/mailinglists.php.dist config/mailinglists.php\n\n\n\n\n\nYou then need to edit this file as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the mailing list functionality by setting this to true:\n\n\n// Set the following to \ntrue\n to enable mailing list functionality:\n\n\nenabled\n =\n true,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this is not set to true, the user will not be offered subscription options and the CLI/API commands will not execute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the available mailing list(s) in the \nlists\n array. Here is an example:\n\n\nlists\n =\n [\n\n\n    \nmembers\n =\n [\n\n\n        \nname\n    =\n \nMembers\n Mailing List\n,\n\n\n        \ndesc\n    =\n \nA longer description as presented in IXP Manager.\n,\n\n\n        \nemail\n   =\n \nmembers@example.com\n,\n\n\n        \narchive\n =\n \nhttps://www.example.com/mailman/private/members/\n,\n\n\n    ],\n\n\n    \ntech\n =\n [\n\n\n        \nname\n    =\n \nTech/Operations Mailing List\n,\n\n\n        \ndesc\n    =\n \nA longer description as presented in IXP Manager.\n,\n\n\n        \nemail\n   =\n \ntech@example.com\n,\n\n\n        \narchive\n =\n \nhttps://www.example.com/mailman/private/tech/\n,\n\n\n    ],\n\n\n],\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the \nmembers\n and \ntech\n array keys above are the list handles that will be used by the API interfaces later. It is also important that they match the Mailman list key.\n\n\nHistorically, mailing list passwords were also sync'd from the IXP Manager user database \nunless\n \nsyncpws\n is both defined and false for the given list. As we are now enforcing \nbcrypt\n as the standard password hashing mechanism, we no longer support this and suggest allowing Mailman to manage its own passwords.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaths to Mailman commands. These will be used in the API/CLI elements later:\n\n\nmailman\n =\n [\n\n\n    \ncmds\n =\n [\n\n\n        \nlist_members\n   =\n \n/usr/local/mailman/bin/list_members\n,\n\n\n        \nadd_members\n    =\n \n/usr/local/mailman/bin/add_members -r - -w n -a n\n,\n\n\n        \nremove_members\n =\n \n/usr/local/mailman/bin/remove_members -f - -n -N\n,\n\n\n        \nchangepw\n       =\n \n/usr/local/mailman/bin/withlist -q -l -r changepw\n\n\n    ]\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of Usage\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis mailing list synchronisation / integration code was written for existing Mailman lists we have at INEX where some lists are public with subscribers that will never have an account on INEX's IXP Manager. As such, these scripts are written so that email addresses in common between IXP Manager and Mailman can manage their subscriptions in IXP Manager but those other subscribers will be unaffected.\n\n\nUsers in IXP Manager will either be marked as being subscribed to a list, not subscribed to a list or neither (i.e. a new user). Subscriptions are managed by user preferences (in the database) of the format:\n\n\nmailinglist.listname1.subscribed = 0/1\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three steps to performing the synchronisation \nfor each list\n which are done by either using the IXP Manager CLI script \nartisan mailing-list:...\n or the \nAPI\n interface.\n\n\nCLI Interface Overview\n\uf0c1\n\n\nNB:\n these relate to the CLI as implemented from IXP Manager \n= v4.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe execution of the \nartisan mailing-list:init\n script which is really for new IXP Manager users (or initial set up of the mailing list feature). This script is piped the full subscribers list from Mailman (via \nlist_members\n). This function will iterate through all users and, if they have no preference set for subscription to this list, will either add a \"not subscribed\" preference if their email address is not in the provided list of subscribers or a \"subscribed\" preference if it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe execution of the \nartisan mailing-list:get-subscribers\n action which lists all users who are subscribed to the given mailing list based on their user preferences. This is piped to the \nadd_members\n Mailman script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe execution of the \nartisan mailing-list:get-subscribers --unsubscribed\n action which lists all users who are unsubscribed to the given mailing list based on their user preferences. This is piped to the \nremove_members\n Mailman script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI V4 Interface Overview\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe API v4 implementation was added in IXP Manager v4.7. See the end of this document for the API v1 implementation in previous versions of IXP Manager.\n\n\nIf you wish to use the API version, proceed as follows where:\n\n\n\n\n$KEY\n is one of your SUPERUSER API keys (see \nhere\n for details);\n\n\nhttps://ixp.example.com\n is your IXP Manager web interface;\n\n\nmembers\n is an example mailing list handle as defined above in \n$IXPROOT/config/mailinglists.php\n.\n\n\n\n\nUse the initialisation function for new IXP Manager users (or initial set up of the mailing list feature) which updates IXP Manager with all currently subscribed mailing list members:\n\n\n/path/to/mailman/bin/list_members members \n/tmp/ml-members.txt\ncurl -f --data-urlencode addresses@/tmp/ml-members.txt \n\\\n\n    -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: \n$KEY\n -X POST\n    \nhttps://ixp.example.co/api/v4/mailing-list/init/members\n\nrm /tmp/ml-members.txt\n\n\n\n\n\nPipe all subscribed users to the \nadd_members\n Mailman script:\n\n\ncurl -f -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: \n$KEY\n -X GET \n\\\n\n    \nhttps://ixp.example.co/api/v4/mailing-list/subscribers/members\n \n|\n \n\\\n\n    /path/to/mailman/bin/add_members -r - -w n -a n members \n/dev/null\n\n\n\n\n\nPipe all users who are unsubscribed to the \nremove_members\n Mailman script:\n\n\ncurl -f -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: \n$KEY\n -X GET \n\\\n\n    \nhttps://ixp.example.co/api/v4/mailing-list/unsubscribed/members\n \n|\n \n\\\n\n    /path/to/mailman/bin/remove_members -f - -n -N members \n/dev/null\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Implement\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou can implement mailing list management by configuring IXP Manager as above.\n\n\nIXP Manager will generate shell scripts to manage all of the above.\n\n\nExecute the following command for the CLI version \n(and make sure to update the assignments at the top of the script)\n:\n\n\nartisan mailing-list:sync-script --sh\n\n\n\n\n\nOr the following for the API V4 version \n(and make sure to update the assignments at the top of the script)\n:\n\n\nartisan mailing-list:sync-script\n\n\n\n\n\nThis generates a script which performs each of the above four steps for each configured mailing list. If your mailing list configuration does not change, you will not need to rerun this.\n\n\nYou should now put this script into crontab on the appropriate server (same server for CLI!) and run as often as you feel is necessary. The current \nsuccess\n message for a user updating their subscriptions says \nwithin 12 hours\n so we'd recommend at least running twice a day.\n\n\nTodo\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nbetter handling of multiple users with the same email address and documentation of same\n\n\nuser changes email address\n\n\n\n\nAPI V1 Interface Overview\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDEPRECATED\n and only available in IXP Manager \nv4.7.\n\n\nThe CLI version of mailing list management was presented above.

You need a working Nagios installation first and then IXP Manager will automate the above areas of the configuration.\n\n\nHistorical Notes\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIf you have used Nagios on IXP Manager \n4.5, then how the configuration is generated has changed. The \nolder documentation may be available here\n. In previous versions of IXP Manager, we generated entire / monolithic Nagios configuration files. We have found in practice that this does not scale well and creates a number of limitations.\n\n\nIXP Manager \n= v4.5 now simply creates the targets on a per VLAN and protocol basis.\n\n\nSample Scripts\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou will find sample scripts for pulling Nagios configuration from IXP Manager and reloading Nagios at:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/tree/master/tools/runtime/nagios\n\n\nMonitoring Member Reachability\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWe monitor all member router interfaces (unless asked not to) via ICMP[v6] pings with Nagios. This is all controlled by the Nagios configuration created with this feature.\n\n\nTo enable / disable these checks, edit the VLAN interface configuration and set IPvX Can Ping appropriately. \nNote that when IPvX Can Ping is disabled, the host definition is created anyway as this would be used for other Nagios checks such as route collector sessions.\n\n\nThere is an additional option when editing a member's VLAN interface called \nBusy Host\n. This changes the Nagios ping fidelity from \n250.0,20%!500.0,60%\n to \n1000.0,80%!2000.0,90%\n (using the default object definitions which are configurable). This is useful for routers with slow / rate limited control planes.\n\n\nMembers are added to a number of hostgroups also:\n\n\n\n\na per-switch hostgroup;\n\n\na per cabinet hostgroup;\n\n\na per location / data centre hostgroup;\n\n\nan all members hostgroup.\n\n\n\n\nThese hostgroups are very useful to single out issues and for post-maintenance checks.\n\n\nYou can use the \nIXP Manager\n API to get the Nagios configuration for a given VLAN and protocol using the following endpoint format (both GET and POST requests work):\n\n\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/nagios/customers/{vlanid}/{protocol}\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\nvlanid\n is the database ID (\nDB ID\n) of the VLAN. You can find the DB ID in IXP Manager in the VLAN table (select \nVLANs\n from the left hand side menu).\n\n\nprotocol\n is either \n4\n for \nIPv4\n or 6 for \nIPv6\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf either of these are invalid, the API will return with a HTTP 404 response.\n\n\nAnd example of a target in the reponse is:\n\n\n###############################################################################################\n###\n### Packet Clearing House DNS\n###\n### Equinix DB2 (Kilcarbery) / Packet Clearing House DNS / swi1-kcp1-1.\n###\n\n### Host: 185.6.36.60 / inex.woodynet.net / Peering VLAN #1.\n\ndefine host {\n    use                     ixp-manager-member-host\n    host_name               packet-clearing-house-dns-as42-ipv4-vlanid2-vliid109\n    alias                   Packet Clearing House DNS / swi1-kcp1-1 / Peering VLAN #1.\n    address                 185.6.36.60\n}\n\n### Service: 185.6.36.60 / inex.woodynet.net / Peering VLAN #1.\n\ndefine service {\n    use                     ixp-manager-member-ping-service\n    host_name               packet-clearing-house-dns-as42-ipv4-vlanid2-vliid109\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Nagios for Member Reachability\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou will notice that the above configuration example is very light and is missing an awful lot of Nagios required configuration directives. This is intentional so that IXP Manager is not too prescriptive and allows you to define your own Nagios objects without having to resort to skinning IXP Manager.\n\n\nTwo of the most important elements of Nagios configuration which you need to understand are \nobject definitions\n and \nobject inheritance\n.\n\n\nYou can pass three optional parameters to Nagios via GET/POST and these are:\n\n\n\n\nhost_definition\n; defaults to: \nixp-manager-member-host\n.\n\n\nservice_definition\n; defaults to \nixp-manager-member-service\n.\n\n\nping_service_definition\n; defaults to: \nixp-manager-member-ping-service\n.\n\n\nping_busy_service_definition\n; defaults to: \nixp-manager-member-ping-busy-service\n.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of changing two of these parameters is:\n\n\ncurl --data \nhost_definition=my-host-def\nservice_definition=my-service-def\n -X POST \n\\\n\n    -H \nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n \n\\\n\n    -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\n \n\\\n\n    https://ixpexample.com/api/v4/nagios/customers/2/4\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of the three objects that INEX use for this are:\n\n\ndefine host {\n    name                    ixp-manager-member-host\n    check_command           check-host-alive\n    check_period            24x7\n    max_check_attempts      10\n    notification_interval   120\n    notification_period     24x7\n    notification_options    d,u,r\n    contact_groups          admins\n    register                0\n}\n\ndefine service {\n    name                    ixp-manager-member-service\n    check_period            24x7\n    max_check_attempts      10\n    check_interval          5\n    retry_check_interval    1\n    contact_groups          admins\n    notification_interval   120\n    notification_period     24x7\n    notification_options    w,u,c,r\n    register                0\n}\n\ndefine service {\n    name                    ixp-manager-member-ping-service\n    use                     ixp-manager-member-service\n    service_description     PING\n    check_command           check_ping!250.0,20%!500.0,60%\n    register                0\n}\n\ndefine service {\n    name                    ixp-manager-member-ping-busy-service\n    use                     ixp-manager-member-service\n    service_description     PING-Busy\n    check_command           check_ping!1000.0,80%!2000.0,90%\n    register                0\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nTemplates / Skinning\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou can use \nskinning\n to make changes to the bundled \ndefault\n template or, \npreferably\n, add your own.\n\n\nLet's say you wanted to add your own template called \nmytemplate1\n and your skin is named \nmyskin\n. The best way to proceed is to copy the bundled example:\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\nmkdir -p resources/skins/myskin/api/v4/nagios/customers\ncp resources/views/api/v4/nagios/customers/default.foil.php resources/skins/myskin/api/v4/nagios/customers/mytemplate1.foil.php\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now edit this template as required. The only constraint on the template name is it can only contain characters from the classes \na-z, 0-9, -\n. \nNB:\n do not use uppercase characters.\n\n\nYou can then elect to use this template by tacking the name onto the API request:\n\n\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/nagios/customers/{vlanid}/{protocol}/{template}\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere, in this example, \n{template}\n would be: \nmytemplate1\n.\n\n\nAs a policy, INEX tends to use the bundled templates and as such they should be fit for general purpose.\n\n\nSwitch Monitoring\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWe monitor all production peering LAN switches for a number of difference services (see below).\n\n\nIXP Manager produces a host configuration for each production switch such as:\n\n\n#\n# swi2-dc1-1 - DUB01.XX.YY.ZZ, Data Centre DUB1.\n#\n\ndefine host {\n    use                     ixp-manager-production-switch\n    host_name               swi2-dc1-1.mgmt.inex.ie\n    alias                   swi2-dc1-1\n    address                 192.0.2.4\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers are added to a number of hostgroups also:\n\n\n\n\nswitches per location / data centre;\n\n\nall switches in the requested infrastructure;\n\n\ngrouped by vendor name (the vendor's \nshortname\n as defined in IXP Manager);\n\n\ngrouped by vendor model (as discovered by SNMP).\n\n\n\n\nThese hostgroups are very useful when defining service checks.\n\n\nYou can use the \nIXP Manager\n API to get the Nagios configuration for a given infrastructure using the following endpoint format (both GET and POST requests work):\n\n\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/nagios/switches/{infraid}\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\ninfraid\n is the database ID (\nDB ID\n) of the infrastructure.

An example of the hostgroups produced include:\n\n\n\n\nixp-production-switches-infraid-2\n: all switches on an infrastructure with DB ID 2;\n\n\nixp-switches-infraid-2-dc-dub1\n: all switches in location dc-dub1;\n\n\nixp-switches-infraid-2-extreme\n: all Extreme switches on an infrastructure with DB ID 2; and\n\n\nixp-switches-infraid-2-extreme-x670g2-48x-4q\n: all Extreme switches of model X670G2-48x-4q on an infrastructure with DB ID 2.\n\n\n\n\nUsing these, you can create generic service definitions to apply to all hosts such as:\n\n\ndefine service{\n    use                             my-ixp-production-switch-service\n    hostgroup_name                  ixp-production-switches-infraid-1, ixp-production-switches-infraid-2\n    service_description             ping - IPv4\n    check_command                   check_ping_ipv4!10!100.0,10%!200.0,20%\n}\n\ndefine service  {\n    use                             my-ixp-production-switch-service\n    hostgroup_name                  ixp-production-switches-infraid-1, ixp-production-switches-infraid-2\n    service_description             SSH\n    check_command                   check_ssh\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can target vendor / model specific checks as appropriate:\n\n\ndefine service{\n    use                             my-ixp-production-switch-service\n    hostgroup_name                  ixp-switches-infraid-1-extreme, ixp-switches-infraid-2-extreme\n    service_description             Chassis\n    check_command                   check_extreme_chassis\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one thing you'll need to keep an eye on is adding hostgroups to service checks as you create new infrastructures / add new switch vendors / models.\n\n\nHint:\n over the years, we at \nINEX\n have written a number of switch chassis check scripts and these can be found on Github at \nbarryo/nagios-plugins\n.\n\n\nFor example the Extreme version checks and returns something like:\n\n\n\n\nOK - CPU: 5sec - 10%.

To enable / disable these checks, edit the VLAN interface configuration and set IPvX Can Ping appropriately.  Note that when IPvX Can Ping is disabled, the host definition is created anyway as this would be used for other Nagios checks such as route collector sessions.  There is an additional option when editing a member's VLAN interface called  Busy Host . This changes the Nagios ping fidelity from  250.0,20%!500.0,60%  to  1000.0,80%!2000.0,90%  (using the default object definitions which are configurable). This is useful for routers with slow / rate limited control planes.  Members are added to a number of hostgroups also:   a per-switch hostgroup;  a per cabinet hostgroup;  a per location / data centre hostgroup;  an all members hostgroup.   These hostgroups are very useful to single out issues and for post-maintenance checks.  You can use the  IXP Manager  API to get the Nagios configuration for a given VLAN and protocol using the following endpoint format (both GET and POST requests work):  https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/nagios/customers/{vlanid}/{protocol}  where:   vlanid  is the database ID ( DB ID ) of the VLAN. You can find the DB ID in IXP Manager in the VLAN table (select  VLANs  from the left hand side menu).  protocol  is either  4  for  IPv4  or 6 for  IPv6 .   If either of these are invalid, the API will return with a HTTP 404 response.

We have approached the issue a number of times in IXP Manger but abandoned the attempt every time. Typically our original solutions were over-engineered where all we really needed was something which could replace a spreadsheet per panel.\n\n\nWe believe we have now developed a feature complete and useful means of managing patch panels and associated cross connects.\n\n\nFeatures\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nAdd / edit patch panels  (which includes cable and connector types).\n\n\nList associated patch panel ports which includes:\n\n\ntheir state (such as available / prewired, awaiting cross connect, connected, awaiting cease, reserved, broken).\n\n\nassociated customer and/or switchport.\n\n\nco-location provider's circuit reference.\n\n\ninternal ticket references.\n\n\nTransition ports from available / prewired to awaiting x-connect to connected to awaiting cease to ceased and then available again.\n\n\nCustomer view of their cross connects.\n\n\nPublic (visible to customers) and private notes per cross connect.\n\n\nAttach public and private files to cross connects (such as test results, completion documents, order forms, etc).\n\n\nMaintain complete history of a patch panel port.\n\n\nGenerate and email LoAs (as PDF) with a URL verification function for co-location providers.\n\n\nGenerate emails for connection and cease requests as well as an email providing full customer view of a cross connect.\n\n\nTypically fibre ports are \nduplex\n ports but there is a growing use of BiDi optics meaning simplex ports. Our implementation treats all ports as simplex but you can mark it as duplex and set its partner port.\n\n\n\n\nDuplex Fibre Ports\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWe suggest adding fibre ports as two ports per duplex port. I.e. if your patch panel has 12 duplex ports, enter this as 24 ports. When allocating ports later, you can set it as a duplex port and select its \npartner / slave port\n. This will future proof your patch panels for the growing use of bidi optics and other simplex based xWDM fibre solutions.\n\n\nFrom our experience, duplex fibre ports are often identified as their individual strands. For example, \nduplex port 5\n would be referenced as \nF9/F10\n.\n\n\nYour mileage may vary on this but we need to allow this flexibility to cover both use-cases. You always have options however:\n\n\n\n\nyou can change the presentation of how these ports are referenced externally by \nskinning\n the templates.\n\n\nyou have the option to edit emails before they are sent to also present this as you wish.\n\n\nyou can chose to treat duplex ports as single ports rather than doubling them up.\n\n\nwhen you have duplex ports on a patch panel, IXP Manager will provide a duplex view by default with a CSS-based toggle to reveal the typical partner ports.\n\n\nif you think IXP Manager can make this easier, please talk to us. \nBut we cannot cover every use case programatically. We've opted to allow flexibility rather than dictate a particular format.\n\n\n\n\nAdding a Patch Panel\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe following image shows a typical \nadd a new patch panel\n form (as of v4.3). You'll note that clicking \nHelp\n provides detailed context aware help messages.\n\n\n\n\nMost of this is self-explanatory but:\n\n\n\n\nBy default, we set the \nColocation Reference\n to the \nPatch Panel Name\n. We are not sure it's a good idea for IXPs to create a second name different to the co-location provider's but this option is available to you. \nSeriously, think about what you are doing here - more references means more confusion!\n The cabinet and cable type is displayed in the list of patch panels so even with obscure data centre references, it should be easy to find what you need.\n\n\nLocation Notes\n: Data centre / co-location providers do a lot of weird, wonderful and strange things! They provide multiple references for a single patch panel (IXP cabinet, MMR, etc.), they get taken over and re-reference everything or even provide no discernable reference. The field is a freetext field that will be included (and parsed as Markdown) in all emails generated by IXP Manager to help you help them identify a patch panel!\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to that, we will also use a cabinets \nU's are counted from top/bottom\n, and a patch panel's \nU position\n and \nmounted at front/rear\n to also create a location description.\n\n When setting the \nNumber of Ports\n, ensure you count duplex fibre ports as \ntwo ports\n. So 12 duplex fibre ports would be entered as 24. When editing a patch panel, this input field represents the number of additional ports you want to add to a patch panel and thus defaults to 0 in that situation.\n\n \nPort Name Prefix\n: This is an optional field intended for use on fibre patch panels. As an example, you may wish to prefix individual fibre strands in a duplex port with F which would mean the name of a duplex port would be displayed as F1/F2.\n* \nChargeable\n: Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. Setting this only sets the default option when allocating ports to members later. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other.\n\n\nFiltering Patch Panel Ports\n\uf0c1\n\n\nQuite often, all you are looking for is a free in a particular location (data centre) or cabinet of a particular cable type (UTP / SMF / etc.).\n\n\nIXP Manager makes this easy from the \nPatch Panels\n page via the top right button labeled \nFilter Options\n. When clicked, this yields an advanced search as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCabinets auto-fills when you chose (or change) a location.\n\n\nPatch Panel Port States\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA patch panel port can have the following states:\n\n\n\n\nAvailable\n: The port is free and available for use.\n\n\nPrewired\n: This is equivalent to available but it means the port is prewired to a given switchport (you set the port when setting the prewired status). This is useful for IXPs that prewire a bunch of ports to avoid remote hands costs / data centre visits.\n\n\nAwaiting Xconnect\n: Port has been assigned to a member and we are awaiting the co-location provider to install the cross connect. In this state, context aware actions such as emailing connection requests, LoA generation and \nSet Connected\n are all available.\n\n\nConnected\n: Connected and in use.\n\n\nAwaiting Cease\n: This connection is no longer required and we are awaiting the end user / co-location provider to cease the connection.\n\n\nCeased\n: You will never see a ceased state. When a cross connect is marked as ceased, it's current state is archived (for history, include files) and the port is reset to \nAvailable\n. We do not revert to \nPrewired\n but an information message is shown to the user to hint this.\n\n\nReserved\n: Useful to mark particular ports as \noff limits\n for whatever reason.\n\n\nBroken\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\nFree / Available Ports\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIXP Manager will colour ports in the \nAvailable\n, \nPrewired\n and \nAwaiting Cease\n states are green allowing an easy visual indication of available ports.\n\n\nPatch Panel Port Lifecycle\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPatch panel ports start as either \navailable\n or \nprewired\n. The context menu in these states is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnset Prewired\n is available as this port has a \nPrewired\n status. Clicking this reverts it to plain \nAvailable\n and disassociates it from the prewired port.\n\n\nEdit Note...\n is always available and provides a pop up to edit public and private notes associated with the port (current lifecycle - ceased ports have their notes at that time archived and cleared).\n\n\n\n\nThe main lifecycle option here is \nAllocate\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n: A one line short description to be shown in the list of patch panel ports. Just enough to help explain the ports purpose. Detailed information should be placed in the notes section. Can also be used to explain a reserved / broken / other port. Note that this is parsed as Markdown. \nNB:\n A description is discouraged for customer ports connected to a switch. The customer name and switch port are the description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColocation Circuit Reference\n: this is the reference provided by the colocation provider to uniquely reference this cross connect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTicket Reference(s)\n: This is a free text field to be used by IXPs as they wish. The intended use is to enter helpdesk ticket references that relate to this cross connect order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuplex connection?\n: Clicking this allows you to select the slave port for duplex connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch / Switch Port\n / \nCustomer\n: You have a number of options when allocating a port:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the port is pre-wired then the switch / switch port will be set here.\n\n\n\n\nIf you chose a switch port which has been allocated to a customer, then this patch panel port will also be allocated to that customer. The backend logic will detect if this is the case and update the customer field.\n\n\nConversely, if you chose a customer first, the switch / switch port dropdowns will be populated with only that customer's assigned ports.\n\n\nSometimes you will get cross connects that are not intended to be connected to peering switches (e.g. connections to co-located customer equipment, IXP metro connections, etc.). In these cases, just select the customer (and if it's the IXP itself, select the IXP customer) and leave switch / switch port unselected.\n\n\n\n\nIf you need to reset these fields, just click either of the Reset button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatch Panel Port Status\n: when allocating a port, this will allow you to set the state to \nAwaiting Xconnect\n or \nConnected\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Interface Status\n: this is not depicted above. If the selected switch port has already been assigned to a customer by way of a physical interface, you will have the option to update this here also.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic\n and \nPrivate Notes\n: Public notes are available to the customer. Both fields are interpreted as Markdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChargeable\n: Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other. How individual IXPs use this is up to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Use\n: Marks the port as used by the IXP itself. E.g. metro connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwned By\n: Useful indication for billing and cease requests. Should represent the contractural owner of the cross connect. One of: Customer, IXP, Service Provider, Data Centre, Other. \nService Provider\n might be a metro provider where they ordered the cross connect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce a port is allocated, it enters the \nAwaiting XConnect\n / \nConnected\n state and there are additional context menu options available:\n\n\n\n\nThe three lifecycle actions are:\n\n\n\n\nSet Connected\n: updates the status (and allows you to add public/private notes). You next action after this should be \nEmail - Connect\n.\n\n\nSet Awaiting Cease\n: mark the port and pending disconnection. Your next action after this should be \nEmail - Cease\n.\n\n\nSet Ceased\n: this is a \ntransitive state\n in that it doesn't \nstick\n. When you mark a patch panel as ceased, the existing details (including files and notes) are archived as part of the port's history and then port is then cleared and made available again.\n\n\n\n\nFile Attachments\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOver the lifetime of a cross connect - and particularly when it is being ordered, there may be files exchanges between you and your customers or the colocation provider. These can be added to the patch panel port via the \nAttach File...\n option.\n\n\nThe dialog will dynamically determine the maximum file upload size based on your PHP settings. To alter this, change the following in your server's appropriate \nphp.ini\n:\n\n\n; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.\nupload_max_filesize = 40M\n\n; Must be greater than or equal to upload_max_filesize\npost_max_size = 40M\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease search the internet for further help as this is outside the scope of IXP Manager documentation.\n\n\nThe following features apply to file attachments:\n\n\n\n\nthey are archived along with the port history when a cross connect is ceased.\n\n\nthey are stored under \n$IXPROOT/storage/files/ppp\n.\n\n\ntwo files of the same name cannot be uploaded for a single patch panel port.\n\n\nthey can be marked as public or private:\n\n\npublic files are accessible to the customer through their own dashboard.\n\n\npublic files are attached to the \nEmail - Information\n email.\n\n\n\n\nLoA Generation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nMany co-location providers will not accept a cross connect order without a LoA \n(Letter of Agency/Authority)\n from the party to whom the cross connect is to be delivered (typically the IXP).\n\n\nIXP Manager will generate a PDF LoA to download or include in the emails it generates for you. Here is an example:\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to \nskin\n this yourself to change the legalese, address and contact details and potentially add a logo. See the version INEX uses \nhere\n (which includes and embedded PNG logo).\n\n\nNote that \nDompdf\n is used to turn the HTML template into a PDF and it has some restrictions.\n\n\nYou have two options for generating LoAs (without having IXP Manager email them):\n\n\n\n\nDownload PDF\n: downloads the PDF via your browser.\n\n\nView PDF\n: displays the PDF LoA in your browser (where browser supports it).\n\n\n\n\nLoA Verification\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe stock LoA template (and INEX's version) includes a link that allows co-location browsers to click on to verify its veracity.\n\n\nOn successful verification, the end user sees:\n\n\n\n\nEmail Generation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIXP Manager allows you to send four emails related to patch panels / cross connects (port status dependent). These are listed below. The Email editor looks as follows:\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\n\n\n\nthe option to attach a PDF LoA is a checkbox.\n\n\nthe email is written in Markdown with a preview available. The email is sent as both HTML (from the Markdown) and the plaintext version.\n\n\n\n\nThe four email templates available are:\n\n\n\n\nEmail - Connect\n: Email the customer a request to order a cross connect to the given demarcation points. A LoA is attached as a PDF by default unless you uncheck the box in the email editor.\n\n\nEmail - Cease\n: Email the customer a request to cease a cross connect.\n\n\nEmail - Information\n: Email the customer all details on file about a cross connect. We often get requests for this at INEX and this simplifies the process. The generated email includes:\n\n\nthe standard details regarding port and co-location reference;\n\n\npublic notes;\n\n\npublic files as attachments.\n\n\nEmail - LoA\n: Email a LoA to the customer as attached as a PDF. This is similar to \nEmail - Connect\n but it is more reflective of a typical response to a second request for a LoA.\n\n\n\n\nAll email templates can be \nskinned\n for your own needs. See INEX's example skins \nhere\n.\n\n\nViewing Patch Panel Details and Archives\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEach patch panel port row has the following button:\n\n\n\n\nThe number in the badge indicates how many historical records are available.\n\n\nClicking on the button yields the following view screen:\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment History\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Patch Panels functionality was developed during Q1 2017 and added in March 2017.

Email - Information : Email the customer all details on file about a cross connect. We often get requests for this at INEX and this simplifies the process. The generated email includes:  the standard details regarding port and co-location reference;  public notes;  public files as attachments.  Email - LoA : Email a LoA to the customer as attached as a PDF. This is similar to  Email - Connect  but it is more reflective of a typical response to a second request for a LoA.   All email templates can be  skinned  for your own needs. See INEX's example skins  here .",

No operator input is required for this.\n\n\nData Source: sflow BGP session detection\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIXP Manager can pick out active BGP sessions from an sflow data feed.  This is handled using the \nsflow-detect-ixp-bgp-sessions\n script.  As this is a perl script, it is necessary to install all the perl modules listed in the \ncheck-perl-dependencies.pl\n script.\n\n\nSflow is a packet sampling mechanism, which means that it will take some while before the peering database is populated. After 24 hours of operation, the peering database should be relatively complete.\n\n\nsflow-detect-ixp-bgp-sessions\n needs its own dedicated sflow data feed, so it is necessary to set up sflow data fan-out using the \nsflowtool\n as described in the \nsflow fan-out section here\n.

A route collector is an IXP router which serves only to \naccept all routes and export no routes\n. It is used for problem diagnosis, to aid customer monitoring and for looking glasses (see \nINEX's here\n).\n\n\nThe \nstandard configuration\n simply pulls in a fairly standard header (sets up router ID, listening address and - for the collector at least - some unused filters) and creates a session for all customer routers on the given VLAN.\n\n\nWhen adding a router, you give it a \nhandle\n. For example: \nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n which, for INEX, would mean a route collector on peering LAN1 using IPv4. Then - for the given router handle - the configuration can be generated and pulled using the API as follows:\n\n\n#! /bin/sh\n\n\n\n# The API Key.\n\n\n# This is generated in IXP Manager via the top right menu: *My Account -\n API Keys*\n\n\nKEY\n=\nyour-admin-ixp-manager-api-key\n\n\n\n# The base URL of your IXP Manager install plus: \napi/v4/router/gen-config\n\n\nURL\n=\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/gen-config\n\n\n\n# The handle is as described above:\n\n\nHANDLE\n=\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n\n\n\n# Then the configuration can be pulled as follows:\n\ncurl --fail -s -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: \n${\nKEY\n}\n \n${\nURL\n}\n/\n${\nHANDLE\n}\n \n${\nHANDLE\n}\n.conf\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigurations for the route server and AS112 templates can be configured just as easily.\n\n\nThe stock templates for both are secure and well tested and can be used by setting the \ntemplate\n element of the router to one of the following:\n\n\n\n\nAS112: \n'api/v4/router/as112/bird/standard'\n\n\nRoute Collector: \n'api/v4/router/collector/bird/standard'\n\n\nRoute Server: \n'api/v4/router/server/bird/standard'\n\n\n\n\nWe also provide sample scripts for automating the re-configuration of these services by cron:\n\n\n\n\nAS112 scripts \ncan be found here\n.\n\n\nRoute collector scripts \ncan be found here\n.\n\n\nRoute server scripts - see the \n-v4\n scripts \nin this directory\n. These are quite robust and have been in production for ~3 years at INEX (as of Jan 2017).\n\n\n\n\nAll of these scripts have been written defensivily such that if there is any issue getting the configuring or validating the configuration then the running router instance should be unaffected. This has worked in practice at INEX when IXP Manager was under maintenance, when there were management connectivity issues and when there were database issues. They also use the \nupdated API\n (see below) to mark when the router configuration update script ran successfully.\n\n\nUpdated API\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIt can be useful to know that the scripts for updating the router configuration for AS112, route collector and route server BGP daemons run successfully. At INEX for example, we have three LANs and so 10 individual servers running a total of 30 Bird instances which is unwieldy to check and monitor manually.\n\n\nWhen viewing routers in IXP Manager, you may have noticed the \nLast Updated\n column which will initially show \n(unknown)\n. All our update scripts (see above) trigger the updated API call when a route configuration run has completed successfully. Note that this does not mean that a configuration has necessarily changed but rather that the update script ran and executed correctly. In other words: \nthe configuration was successfully pulled from IXP Manager, compared to the running configuration and, if changed, successfully applied\n.\n\n\nThe API call to update the \nlast updated\n field to \nnow\n is a POST as follows:\n\n\ncurl -s -X POST -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\n \\\n    https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/updated/{handle}\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n{handle}\n should be replaced with the route handle as described above.\n\n\nThe result is a JSON object with the datetime as set and is equivalent to the result of the following API call which fetchs the \nlast updated\n field without setting it:\n\n\ncurl -s -X GET -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\n \\\n    https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/updated/{handle}\n\n{\nlast_updated\n:\n2017-05-21T19:14:43+00:00\n,\nlast_updated_unix\n:1495394083}\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two useful additional API endpoints. To get the last updated time of \nall\n routers, use:\n\n\ncurl -s -X GET -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\n \\\n    https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/updated\n\n{\nhandle1\n:{\nlast_updated\n:\n2017-05-21T19:14:43+00:00\n,\nlast_updated_unix\n:1495394083},\n \nhandle2\n:{\nlast_updated\n:null,\nlast_updated_unix\n:null},\n ...}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above output shows the format of the reply as well as the fact that routers without a last updated value set will be included as null values.\n\n\nLastly, you can request the last updated time of routers where that time exceeds a given number of seconds. \nIn this call, routers without a last updated time will not be returned.\n This is useful for monitoring applications such as Nagios where you would want a warning / alert on any routers that have not updated in the last day for example:\n\n\ncurl -s -X GET -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\n \\\n    https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/updated-before/86400\n\n[]\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example also shows that an empty JSON object is returned for an empty result. Otherwise the format of the reply is the same as for the call above for all routers:\n\n\n{\nhandle1\n:{\nlast_updated\n:\n2017-05-21T19:14:43+00:00\n,\nlast_updated_unix\n:1495394083},...}\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWe use \nTravis CI\n to test IXP Manager before pushing new releases. The primary purpose of this is to ensure that the configuration for routers generated matches known good configurations from the same sample database.\n\n\nThese known good configurations also serve as useful examples of what the standard IXP Manager configuration generates.\n\n\nSee \nthese known good configurations here\n with the prefix \nci-apiv4-\n and:\n\n\n\n\nas112\n: AS112 router configurations conforming to \nrfc7534\n (AS112 Nameserver Operations) and implementing \nrfc7535\n (AS112 Redirection Using DNAME).

Write simple, clean and concise templates with nothing more than PHP.\n Also, simulaneously supported are Lavael's own \nBlade templates\n which we sometimes use for simple pages.\n\n\nExample\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe \ngraphing\n MRTG configuration generator allows for custom configuration content at the top and bottom of the file. In order to have your custom configuration enabled, you need to skin two files.\n\n\nHere's an example:\n\n\n# position ourselves in the IXP Manager root directory\ncd ${IXPROOT}\n\n# make the skin directory\nmkdir resources/skins/example\n\n# create the full path required for the MRTG configuration files:\nmkdir -p resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg\n\n# copy over the customisation files:\ncp views/services/grapher/mrtg/custom-header.foil.php resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg\ncp views/services/grapher/mrtg/custom-footer.foil.php resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg\n\n# edit the above files as required\nvi resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg/custom-header.plates.php\nvi resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg/custom-footer.plates.php\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, finally, edit \n.env\n and set the skin to use:\n\n\nVIEW_SKIN=\nexample\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can of course skin any file including the non-custom MRTG files as suits your needs.\n\n\nCustom Variables / Configuration Options\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWhen you are skinning your own templates, you may find you need to create custom configuration options for values you do not want to store directly in your own templates. For this, we have a configuration file which is excluded from Git. Initiate it via::\n\n\ncp config/custom.php.dist config/custom.php\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is \nLaravel's standard configuration file format\n (which is an associative PHP array). You can also use Laravel's dotenv variables here too.\n\n\nAs an example, if you were to create a configuration option:\n\n\n?php\n\n\nexample\n \n=\n \n[\n\n    \nkey\n \n=\n \nmy own config value\n,\n\n\n],\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthen in code this would be accessible as:\n\n\n?php\n\n\nconfig\n(\n \ncustom.example.key\n,\n \ndefault value if not set|null\n \n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the second parameter is a default option if the requested configuration setting has not been defined (which defaults to \nnull\n). In templates, this can be accessed the same way or rendered in the template with::\n\n\n?\n=\n \nconfig\n(\n \ncustom.example.key\n,\n \ndefault\n \n)\n \n?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkinning Old Templates\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis is still important as \nIXP Manager\n v4 still uses most of the previous templates.\n\n\nTo skin files found under \napplication/[modules/xxx/]views\n, proceed as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset a skin name in \n.env\n:\n   \nVIEW_SMARTY_SKIN=\nmyskin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncreate a directory with a matching name: \napplication/views/_skins/myskin\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the above \n.env\n option is set, then any pages in its skin directory (using the same directory structure as \napplication/views\n will take precedence over the default template files. This means you do not need to recreate / copy all the default files - just replace the ones you want.\n\n\nFinding Templates\n\uf0c1\n\n\nUsually there is one of two places to find a template:\n\n\n\n\nNew pages in \n=v4: \nresources/views/$controller/$action\n\n\nOld pages from \nv4: \napplication/views/$controller/$action\n\n\n\n\nIf you're skinning, then there's an extra two places:\n\n\n\n\nNew pages in \n=v4: \nresources/skins/$skin/$controller/$action\n\n\nOld pages from \nv4: \napplication/views/_skins/$skin/$controller/$action\n\n\n\n\nThe indicated variables above mean:\n\n\n\n\n$controller\n: typically the first part of the URL (after the main IXP Manager site) for the page you are looking at. Examples include: \npatch-panel\n, \nrouter\n but they may also be deeper API paths such as \napi/v4/router\n.\n\n\n$action\n: the last part of the URL such as \nedit\n.\n\n\n$skin\n: the name of your skin as defined above.\n\n\n\n\nTypically\n, following the URL path in the views directory will yield the template file you need.\n\n\nTo help identify if the page you are looking at is from the \n=v4 code base, we have added a HTML comment to the templates which appears just after the \nhead\n tag as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor \n=v4 (new codebase):\n\n\n!--  IXP MANAGER - template directory: resources/[views|skins] --\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor \nv4 (old codebase):\n\n\n!--  IXP MANAGER - template directory: application/views --",

Presuming it is installed.\n\n\nHistorical Notes\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIf you have used Smokeping on IXP Manager \nv4.5 or between v4.5 and v4.7.3, then how the configuration is generated has changed.\n\n\n\n\nIn versions of IXP Manager \n= v4.5 now simply creates the targets on a per VLAN and protocol basis.\n\n\nIn versions \n=v4.8, the URL endpoint has changed from that which was used in versions between v4.5 and v4.7.3. This was done as Smokeping (latency graphs) were fully integrated into Grapher.\n\n\n\n\nTarget Selection\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis section explains the rules on how a member router (target) is selected to be included in the generated Smokeping configuration.\n\n\nWhen generating a list of targets per VLAN and protocol, the API call to IXP Manager will select all VLAN interfaces (member routers) where:\n\n\n\n\nthat protocol (IPv4/6) is enabled for the member;\n\n\nCan Ping\n has been checked for that protocol; and\n\n\nthe virtual interface pertaining to the VLAN interface has at least on physical interface in the connected state.\n\n\n\n\nGenerating Smokeping Targets\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou can use the \nIXP Manager\n API to get the Smokeping target configurations for a given VLAN and protocol using the following endpoint format (both GET and POST requests work):\n\n\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/grapher/config?backend=smokeping\nvlanid=10\nprotocol=ipv4\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in versions of IXP Manager between v4.5 and v4.7.3, this was: \nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/vlan/smokeping/{vlanid}/{protocol}\n.\n\n\nIn the above, the parameters are:\n\n\n\n\nvlanid\n is the database ID (\nDB ID\n) of the VLAN. You can find the DB ID in IXP Manager in the VLAN table (select \nVLANs\n from the left hand side menu).\n\n\nprotocol\n is either \nipv4\n or \nipv6\n \n(while in versions between v4.5 and v4.7.3, these were just \n4\n and \n6\n respectfully)\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf either of these are invalid, the API will return with a HTTP 404 response.\n\n\nAnd example of a Smokeping target in the response is:\n\n\n# AS112 Reverse DNS / 185.6.36.6\n+++ vlanint_86_ipv4\nmenu = AS112 Reverse DNS (IPv4)\ntitle =  Peering VLAN #1 :: AS112 Reverse DNS via 185.6.36.6\nprobe = FPing\nhost = 185.6.36.6\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Parameters\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou can optionally POST any of the above parameters and none, one or both of the following to change elements of the default template:\n\n\n\n\nlevel\n: the Smokeping level / hierarchy of the target. Defaults to \n+++\n.\n\n\nprobe\n: the probe to use when measuring latency to the target. Defaults for \nFPing\n for IPv4 and \nFPing6\n for IPv6.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of changing these parameters is:\n\n\ncurl --data \nbackend=smokeping\nprotocol=ipv4\nvlanid=10\nlevel=%2B%2B\nprobe=MyPing\n -X POST \n\\\n\n    -H \nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n \n\\\n\n    -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\n \n\\\n\n    https://ixpexample.com/api/v4/grapher/config\n\n\n\n\n\nTemplates / Skinning\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou can use \nskinning\n to make changes to the bundled \ndefault\n template or, \npreferably\n, add your own.\n\n\nLet's say you wanted to add your own template called \nmytemplate1\n and your skin is named \nmyskin\n. The best way to proceed is to copy the bundled example:\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\nmkdir -p resources/skins/myskin/services/grapher/smokeping\ncp resources/views/services/grapher/smokeping/default.foil.php \n\\\n\n    resources/skins/myskin/services/grapher/smokeping/mytemplate1.foil.php\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now edit this template as required. The only constraint on the template name is it can only contain characters from the classes \na-z, 0-9, -\n. \nNB:\n do not use uppercase characters.\n\n\nThe following variables are available in the template:\n\n\n\n\n$t-\nvlis\n: array of the VLAN interfaces/targets - it is generated \nby the Repositories\\VlanInterface::getForProto() function\n.\n\n\n$t-\nvlan\n: instance of the \nVlan\n entity object\n.\n\n\n$t-\nprotocol\n: either \n4\n or \n6\n.\n\n\n$t-\nprobe\n and \n$t-\nlevel\n as defined above / passed via a post request.\n\n\n\n\nSetting Up Smokeping\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis section explains how to set up Smokeping with IXP Manager. We assume you already have a base install of Smokeping.\n\n\nGenerating / Updating Targets\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAt INEX, we would use a script \nsuch as this one which is bundled with IXP Manager\n to (re)generate our targets by cron and update Smokeping if necessary.\n\n\nTo use this script yourself, you just need to copy it to the appropriate Smokeping server and edit the first few lines:\n\n\nKEY\n=\nmy-ixp-manager-api-key\n\n\nURL\n=\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/grapher/config?backend=smokeping\n\n\nETCPATH\n=\n/etc/smokeping\n\n\nSMOKEPING\n=\n/usr/bin/smokeping\n\n\nSMOKEPING_RELOAD\n=\n/etc/rc.d/smokeping reload\n\n\nVLANS\n=\n1 2\n\n\nPROTOCOLS\n=\nipv4 ipv6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\nKEY\n is your IXP Manager \nAPI key\n.\n\n\nURL\n is the API endpoint as described above.\n\n\nETCPATH\n is where the script puts the target files (named \n$ETCPATH/targets-vlan${vlanid}-${proto}.cfg\n)\n\n\nSMOKEPING\n is the Smokeping binary command. Just used to validate the config with \n--check\n before reloading.\n\n\nSMOKEPING_RELOAD\n - the command to reload Smokeping.\n\n\nVLANS\n - space separated list of VLAN DB IDs as described above. You probably only have one of these typically.\n\n\nPROTOCOLS\n - the protocols to generate the configuration for.\n\n\n\n\nThe script iterates over the VLAN IDs and protocols to create the individual configuration files.\n\n\nUsing Targets in Smokeping\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOnce the above target file(s) are created, we can use them in our standard Smokeping configuration file as follows:\n\n\n+ infra_1\nmenu = IXP Infrastructure 1\ntitle = IXP Infrastructure 1\n\n\n++ vlan_1\nmenu = Peering VLAN 1\ntitle = IXP Infra 1 :: Peering VLAN 1\n\n\n@include targets-vlan1-ipv4.cfg\n@include targets-vlan1-ipv6.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\nApache Configuration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou need to be able to configure IXP Manager with the base Smokeping URL such as \nhttp://www.example.com/smokeping\n. This should be the URL to the standard entry page to Smokeping.\n\n\nIXP Manager will add the trailing slash and assume the directory index is configured for the CGI script. Thus you need an Apache configuration such as:\n\n\nScriptAlias /smokeping/smokeping.cgi /usr/lib/cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi\nAlias /smokeping /usr/share/smokeping/www\n\n\nDirectory \n/usr/share/smokeping/www\n\n    Options FollowSymLinks\n    DirectoryIndex smokeping.cgi\n\n/Directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIXP Manager Configuration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOnce you have configured Smokeping and Apache/web server as above, you really just need to set the following in your IXP Manager \n.env\n file:\n\n\n# Add smokeping to the grapher backends:\nGRAPHER_BACKENDS=\n...|smokeping|...\n\n\n# Mark it as enabled (this just affects whether certain UI elements are shown):\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_SMOKEPING_ENABLED=true\n\n# And set the default location to fetch the Smokeping graphs from:\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_SMOKEPING_URL=\nhttp://www.example.com/smokeping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the URL is as you set up in Apache above.\n\n\nThere may be instances where you have multiple VLANs where it is not possible to have a single Smokeping instance graph latency for all of them. Particularly as the Smokeping daemon for a given VLAN needs to have an interface / IP address on that VLAN.\n\n\nINEX has such a situation where we have a regional exchange, \nINEX Cork\n, that is located in a different city to the main INEX LANs and IXP Manager. In this situation, you can configure Smokeping URL overrides on a per VLAN basis by creating a file called \n$IXPROOT/config/grapher_smokeping_overrides.php\n which returns an array as follows:\n\n\n?php\n\n\n\nreturn\n \n[\n\n\n    \nper_vlan_urls\n \n=\n \n[\n\n        \n2\n \n=\n \nhttp://www.example.com/smokeping\n,\n\n        \n4\n \n=\n \nhttp://www.example2.com/smokeping\n,\n\n    \n],\n\n\n\n];\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the array index (\n2\n and \n4\n in the above example) is the VLAN DB ID as explained above.\n\n\nAny VLANs without a specific override configured in this way will fall back to the \nGRAPHER_BACKEND_SMOKEPING_URL\n setting.\n\n\nViewing Smokeping in IXP Manager\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWhen configured correctly, there will be a latency button available (clock icon) in the member graphs in both the member and admin sections.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSee \nissue #122\n for a discussion on Ubuntu installation and diagnosing issues in general (relates to IXP Manager v3 but may still be useful).\n\n\nIXP Manager will call something like the following to fetch graphs from Smokeping:\n\n\nfile_get_contents( \nhttps://www.example.com/smokeping/?.....\n )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see these requests to Smokeping in your Smokeping web server log files. Find these and compare them to the URLs that Smokeping itself generates for its own display of the images to ensure you have everything - and especially the Smokeping URL in IXP configuration set up correctly.\n\n\nAlso, try testing these URLs directly on the IXP Manager server via:\n\n\nphp -r \necho file_get_contents( \nhttps://...\n );",

[Currently only supported via MRTG for \nprotocol=all\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninfrastructure\n: aggregate graph for the overall traffic on a specific IXP infrastructure. For many IXPs, they'll just have a single infrastructure and this will go unused as it would be the equivalent of \nixp\n above. \nid\n, which is mandatory, is the primary key of the infrastructure from the \ninfrastructure\n database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for \nprotocol=all\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvlan\n: aggregate graph for a specific VLAN. \nid\n, which is mandatory, is the primary key of the VLAN from the \nvlan\n database table. [Currently only supported via sflow for \nprotocol=ipv4|ipv6\n and \ncategory=bits|pkts\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nswitch\n: aggregate graph of all peering traffic being switched by a specific switch (sum of all customer ports plus core ports). \nid\n, which is mandatory, is the primary key of the switch from the \nswitch\n database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for \nprotocol=all\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrunk\n: a legacy hold over from \nInter-Switch / Trunk Graphs\n above to be replaced with core bundles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nphysicalinterface\n: traffic for an individual member port - a single physical switch port. \nid\n, which is mandatory, is the primary key of the physical interface from the \nphysicalinterface\n database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for \nprotocol=all\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvirtualinterface\n: if a member has a single connection (one switch port) then this is the same as \nphysicalinterface\n above. However, if they have a LAG port then it's the aggregate traffic for all physical ports in the LAG. \nid\n, which is mandatory, is the primary key of the virtual interface from the \nvirtualinterface\n database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for \nprotocol=all\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncustomer\n: the aggregate traffic for all ports belonging to a customer across all infrastructures. \nid\n, which is mandatory, is the primary key of the customer from the \ncust\n database table. [Currently only supported via MRTG for \nprotocol=all\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvlaninterface\n: aggregate traffic flowing through a members VLAN interface for a specific protocol. \nid\n, which is mandatory, is the primary key of the VLAN interface from the \nvlaninterface\n database table. [Currently only supported via sflow for \nprotocol=ipv4|ipv6\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlatency\n: latency graphs (e.g. Smokeping). \nid\n, which is mandatory, is the primary key of the VLAN interface from the \nvlaninterface\n database table. \nprotocol=ipv4|ipv6\n is also mandatory. Periods for Smokeping are different to the default periods and should be one of \n3hours|30hours|10days|1year\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\np2p\n: peer to peer traffic between two member VLAN interfaces.

[Currently only supported via sflow for \nprotocol=ipv4|ipv6\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor additional options, it's always best to manually or programmatically examine the output for \ntype=json\n to see what is supported.

To support this we have added the following \n.env\n options (beginning in v4.8) with the default value as shown:\n\n\nGRAPHER_ACCESS_CUSTOMER=\nown_graphs_only\n\nGRAPHER_ACCESS_P2P=\nown_graphs_only\n\nGRAPHER_ACCESS_LATENCY=\nown_graphs_only\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nown_graphs_only\n setting just means \nperform the default access checks\n which are: access is granted to a superuser or a user who belongs to the customer which owns the respective graph. I.e. no one but the customer or a superadmin can access the respective graph.\n\n\nIf you wish to allow access to these to a \nless than or equal\n \nuser permission\n, set the above in \n.env\n appropriately.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\n\nto allow public access to all customer graphs (customer aggregate, LAG aggregates, physical interfaces and per-VLAN/protocol graphs);\n\n\nto allow any logged in customer access any other customer's peer to peer graphs; and\n\n\nto continue to restrict latency graph access to superadmins and the owning customer\n\n\n\n\nthen set the following in \n.env\n:\n\n\nGRAPHER_ACCESS_CUSTOMER=0\nGRAPHER_ACCESS_P2P=1\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that \nGRAPHER_ACCESS_LATENCY\n is omitted as we are not changing the default.\n\n\nPlease note the following:\n\n\n\n\nGRAPHER_ACCESS_CUSTOMER\n applies to customer aggregate graphs, customer LAG graphs (virtualinterface), customer ports (physicalinterface) and customer vlaninterface. T individually limit these makes little sense and drastically increases complexity (from a UI perspectve).\n\n\nIt makes limited sense for UI access to enable either \nGRAPHER_ACCESS_P2P\n or \nGRAPHER_ACCESS_LATENCY\n without enabling equivalent or less restrictive access to \nGRAPHER_ACCESS_CUSTOMER\n. This is because most of the user interface (UI) pathways to access these is via \nGRAPHER_ACCESS_CUSTOMER\n pages.",

A number of IXPs have requested a feature to allow public access to member / customer graphs. To support this we have added the following  .env  options (beginning in v4.8) with the default value as shown:  GRAPHER_ACCESS_CUSTOMER= own_graphs_only \nGRAPHER_ACCESS_P2P= own_graphs_only \nGRAPHER_ACCESS_LATENCY= own_graphs_only   The  own_graphs_only  setting just means  perform the default access checks  which are: access is granted to a superuser or a user who belongs to the customer which owns the respective graph. I.e. no one but the customer or a superadmin can access the respective graph.  If you wish to allow access to these to a  less than or equal   user permission , set the above in  .env  appropriately.  For example:   to allow public access to all customer graphs (customer aggregate, LAG aggregates, physical interfaces and per-VLAN/protocol graphs);  to allow any logged in customer access any other customer's peer to peer graphs; and  to continue to restrict latency graph access to superadmins and the owning customer   then set the following in  .env :  GRAPHER_ACCESS_CUSTOMER=0\nGRAPHER_ACCESS_P2P=1  Note that  GRAPHER_ACCESS_LATENCY  is omitted as we are not changing the default.  Please note the following:   GRAPHER_ACCESS_CUSTOMER  applies to customer aggregate graphs, customer LAG graphs (virtualinterface), customer ports (physicalinterface) and customer vlaninterface. T individually limit these makes little sense and drastically increases complexity (from a UI perspectve).  It makes limited sense for UI access to enable either  GRAPHER_ACCESS_P2P  or  GRAPHER_ACCESS_LATENCY  without enabling equivalent or less restrictive access to  GRAPHER_ACCESS_CUSTOMER . This is because most of the user interface (UI) pathways to access these is via  GRAPHER_ACCESS_CUSTOMER  pages.",

For example:\n\n\nmkdir -p /srv/mrtg\n\n\n\n\n\nIn your `.env, you need to set the following options:\n\n\n# The MRTG database type to use - either log or rrd:\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_DBTYPE=\nrrd\n\n\n# Where to store log/rrd/png files.

On FreeBSD, MRTG comes with an initd script by default and you can kick it off on boot with something like the following in \n/etc/rc.conf\n:\n\n\nmrtg_daemon_enable=\nYES\n\nmrtg_daemon_config=\n/etc/mrtg.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, on Ubuntu it does not but it comes with a \n/etc/cron.d/mrtg\n file which kicks it off every five minutes (it will daemonize the first time and further cron jobs will have no effect).\n\n\nTo start and stop it via standard initd scripts on Ubuntu, use an initd script such as this: \nubuntu-mrtg-initd\n  (\nsource\n):\n\n\ncp ${IXPROOT}/tools/runtime/mrtg/ubuntu-mrtg-initd /etc/init.d/mrtg\nchmod +x /etc/init.d/mrtg\nupdate-rc.d mrtg defaults\n/etc/init.d/mrtg start\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd disable the default cron job for MRTG on Ubuntu (\n/etc/cron.d/mrtg\n).\n\n\nCustomising the Configuration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nGenerally speaking, you should not customize the way IXP Manager generates MRTG configuration as the naming conventions are tightly coupled to how IXP Manager fetches the graphs. However, if there are bits of the MRTG configuration you need to alter, you can do it via \nskinning\n. \nThe skinning documentation actually uses MRTG as an example.\n\n\nInserting Traffic Data Into the Database / Reporting Emails\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe MRTG backend inserts daily summaries into MySQL for reporting. See the \ntraffic_daily\n database table for this. Essentially, there is a row per day per customer for traffic types \nbits, discards, errors, broadcasts and packets\n. Each row has a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly value for average, max and total.\n\n\nAn example crontab for collecting and storing \nyesterday's\n data is as follows. \nThis should run everyday.\n\n\n0 2   * * *   www-data        /srv/ixpmanager/artisan grapher:upload-stats-to-db\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the IXP Manager application, this data powers the \nLeague Table\n function on the left hand menu.\n\n\nThis data is also used to send email reports / notifications of various traffic events. A sample crontab for this would look like the following:\n\n\n0 4   * * *   www-data        /srv/ixpmanager/artisan grapher:email-traffic-deltas    \\\n                                --stddev=1.5 -v user1@example.com,user2@example.com\n\n30 10 * * tue www-data        /srv/ixpmanager/artisan grapher:email-port-utilisations \\\n                                --threshold=80 user1@example.com,user2@example.com\n\n31 10 * * *   www-data        /srv/ixpmanager/artisan grapher:email-ports-with-counts \\\n                                --discards user1@example.com,user2@example.com\n\n32 10 * * *   www-data        /srv/ixpmanager/artisan grapher:email-ports-with-counts \\\n                                --errors user1@example.com,user2@example.com\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich, in the order above, do:\n\n\n\n\nEmail a report of members whose average traffic has changed by more than 1.5 times their standard deviation.\n\n\nEmail a report of all ports with \n=80% utilisation yesterday.\n\n\nEmail a report of all ports with a non-zero discard count yesterday.\n\n\nEmail a report of all ports with a non-zero error count yesterday.\n\n\n\n\nThis generated emails are HTML formatted with embedded graph images.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\uf0c1\n\n\nGeneral Notes\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nIf you have difficulty getting MRTG to work, please also refer the MRTG documentation at https://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/doc/mrtg.en.html\n\n\nAny references to installing MRTG above are guidelines from our own experience. IXP Manager's role is to generate a configuration file for MRTG. It is up to the user to install MRTG as they deem appropriate.\n\n\nThe above assumes that MRTG automatically reconfigures itself when the configuration changes \nas stated in the MRTG documentation for \nRunAsDaemon\n. We have seen inconsistent behaviors for this and if it does not work for you, you will need to add a step to restart the MRTG daemon to the reconfiguration script above (at the very end).\n\n\nThe Ubuntu example above was a pre-systemd example. If anyone has an example of a systemd MRTG daemon configuration please provide us with some updated documentation.\n\n\n\n\nMissing Graphs\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA common issue raised on the mailing list is missing customer graphs. The code which generates MRTG configuration is \nin the MRTG backend file\n (see the function \ngetPeeringPorts()\n).\n\n\nThe conditions for a physical interface allocated to a customer to make the configuration file are:\n\n\n\n\nthe physical interface state must be either \nConnected\n or \nQuarantine\n.\n\n\nthe switch must be \nactive\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not sure about how ports are configured in IXP Manager, please see \nthe interfaces document\n.\n\n\nYou can check the physical interface state by:\n\n\n\n\ngoto the customer's overview page (select customer from dropdown menu on top right).\n\n\nselect the \nPorts\n tab.\n\n\nedit the port via the \nPencil\n icon next to the connection you are interested in.\n\n\nfind the physical interface under \nPhysical Interfaces\n and edit it via the \nPencil\n icon on the right hand side of the row.\n\n\nStatus\n should be either \nConnected\n or \nQuarantine\n.\n\n\n\n\nYou can ensure a switch is active by:\n\n\n\n\nSelect \nSwitches\n from the left hand side \nIXP ADMIN ACTIONS\n menu.\n\n\nClick \nInclude Inactive\n on the top right heading.\n\n\nFind the switch where the physical interface is and ensure \nActive\n is checked.",

Presuming it is installed.\n\n\nHistorical Notes\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIf you have used Smokeping on IXP Manager \nv4.5 or between v4.5 and v4.7.3, then how the configuration is generated has changed.\n\n\n\n\nIn versions of IXP Manager \n= v4.5 now simply creates the targets on a per VLAN and protocol basis.\n\n\nIn versions \n=v4.8, the URL endpoint has changed from that which was used in versions between v4.5 and v4.7.3. This was done as Smokeping (latency graphs) were fully integrated into Grapher.\n\n\n\n\nTarget Selection\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis section explains the rules on how a member router (target) is selected to be included in the generated Smokeping configuration.\n\n\nWhen generating a list of targets per VLAN and protocol, the API call to IXP Manager will select all VLAN interfaces (member routers) where:\n\n\n\n\nthat protocol (IPv4/6) is enabled for the member;\n\n\nCan Ping\n has been checked for that protocol; and\n\n\nthe virtual interface pertaining to the VLAN interface has at least on physical interface in the connected state.\n\n\n\n\nGenerating Smokeping Targets\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou can use the \nIXP Manager\n API to get the Smokeping target configurations for a given VLAN and protocol using the following endpoint format (both GET and POST requests work):\n\n\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/grapher/config?backend=smokeping\nvlanid=10\nprotocol=ipv4\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that in versions of IXP Manager between v4.5 and v4.7.3, this was: \nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/vlan/smokeping/{vlanid}/{protocol}\n.\n\n\nIn the above, the parameters are:\n\n\n\n\nvlanid\n is the database ID (\nDB ID\n) of the VLAN. You can find the DB ID in IXP Manager in the VLAN table (select \nVLANs\n from the left hand side menu).\n\n\nprotocol\n is either \nipv4\n or \nipv6\n \n(while in versions between v4.5 and v4.7.3, these were just \n4\n and \n6\n respectfully)\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf either of these are invalid, the API will return with a HTTP 404 response.\n\n\nAnd example of a Smokeping target in the response is:\n\n\n# AS112 Reverse DNS / 185.6.36.6\n+++ vlanint_86_ipv4\nmenu = AS112 Reverse DNS (IPv4)\ntitle =  Peering VLAN #1 :: AS112 Reverse DNS via 185.6.36.6\nprobe = FPing\nhost = 185.6.36.6\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional Parameters\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou can optionally POST any of the above parameters and none, one or both of the following to change elements of the default template:\n\n\n\n\nlevel\n: the Smokeping level / hierarchy of the target. Defaults to \n+++\n.\n\n\nprobe\n: the probe to use when measuring latency to the target. Defaults for \nFPing\n for IPv4 and \nFPing6\n for IPv6.\n\n\n\n\nAn example of changing these parameters is:\n\n\ncurl --data \nbackend=smokeping\nprotocol=ipv4\nvlanid=10\nlevel=%2B%2B\nprobe=MyPing\n -X POST \n\\\n\n    -H \nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n \n\\\n\n    -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: my-ixp-manager-api-key\n \n\\\n\n    https://ixpexample.com/api/v4/grapher/config\n\n\n\n\n\nTemplates / Skinning\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou can use \nskinning\n to make changes to the bundled \ndefault\n template or, \npreferably\n, add your own.\n\n\nLet's say you wanted to add your own template called \nmytemplate1\n and your skin is named \nmyskin\n. The best way to proceed is to copy the bundled example:\n\n\ncd\n \n$IXPROOT\n\nmkdir -p resources/skins/myskin/services/grapher/smokeping\ncp resources/views/services/grapher/smokeping/default.foil.php \n\\\n\n    resources/skins/myskin/services/grapher/smokeping/mytemplate1.foil.php\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now edit this template as required. The only constraint on the template name is it can only contain characters from the classes \na-z, 0-9, -\n. \nNB:\n do not use uppercase characters.\n\n\nThe following variables are available in the template:\n\n\n\n\n$t-\nvlis\n: array of the VLAN interfaces/targets - it is generated \nby the Repositories\\VlanInterface::getForProto() function\n.\n\n\n$t-\nvlan\n: instance of the \nVlan\n entity object\n.\n\n\n$t-\nprotocol\n: either \n4\n or \n6\n.\n\n\n$t-\nprobe\n and \n$t-\nlevel\n as defined above / passed via a post request.\n\n\n\n\nSetting Up Smokeping\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis section explains how to set up Smokeping with IXP Manager. We assume you already have a base install of Smokeping.\n\n\nGenerating / Updating Targets\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAt INEX, we would use a script \nsuch as this one which is bundled with IXP Manager\n to (re)generate our targets by cron and update Smokeping if necessary.\n\n\nTo use this script yourself, you just need to copy it to the appropriate Smokeping server and edit the first few lines:\n\n\nKEY\n=\nmy-ixp-manager-api-key\n\n\nURL\n=\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/grapher/config?backend=smokeping\n\n\nETCPATH\n=\n/etc/smokeping\n\n\nSMOKEPING\n=\n/usr/bin/smokeping\n\n\nSMOKEPING_RELOAD\n=\n/etc/rc.d/smokeping reload\n\n\nVLANS\n=\n1 2\n\n\nPROTOCOLS\n=\nipv4 ipv6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\nKEY\n is your IXP Manager \nAPI key\n.\n\n\nURL\n is the API endpoint as described above.\n\n\nETCPATH\n is where the script puts the target files (named \n$ETCPATH/targets-vlan${vlanid}-${proto}.cfg\n)\n\n\nSMOKEPING\n is the Smokeping binary command. Just used to validate the config with \n--check\n before reloading.\n\n\nSMOKEPING_RELOAD\n - the command to reload Smokeping.\n\n\nVLANS\n - space separated list of VLAN DB IDs as described above. You probably only have one of these typically.\n\n\nPROTOCOLS\n - the protocols to generate the configuration for.\n\n\n\n\nThe script iterates over the VLAN IDs and protocols to create the individual configuration files.\n\n\nUsing Targets in Smokeping\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOnce the above target file(s) are created, we can use them in our standard Smokeping configuration file as follows:\n\n\n+ infra_1\nmenu = IXP Infrastructure 1\ntitle = IXP Infrastructure 1\n\n\n++ vlan_1\nmenu = Peering VLAN 1\ntitle = IXP Infra 1 :: Peering VLAN 1\n\n\n@include targets-vlan1-ipv4.cfg\n@include targets-vlan1-ipv6.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\nApache Configuration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou need to be able to configure IXP Manager with the base Smokeping URL such as \nhttp://www.example.com/smokeping\n. This should be the URL to the standard entry page to Smokeping.\n\n\nIXP Manager will add the trailing slash and assume the directory index is configured for the CGI script. Thus you need an Apache configuration such as:\n\n\nScriptAlias /smokeping/smokeping.cgi /usr/lib/cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi\nAlias /smokeping /usr/share/smokeping/www\n\n\nDirectory \n/usr/share/smokeping/www\n\n    Options FollowSymLinks\n    DirectoryIndex smokeping.cgi\n\n/Directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIXP Manager Configuration\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOnce you have configured Smokeping and Apache/web server as above, you really just need to set the following in your IXP Manager \n.env\n file:\n\n\n# Add smokeping to the grapher backends:\nGRAPHER_BACKENDS=\n...|smokeping|...\n\n\n# Mark it as enabled (this just affects whether certain UI elements are shown):\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_SMOKEPING_ENABLED=true\n\n# And set the default location to fetch the Smokeping graphs from:\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_SMOKEPING_URL=\nhttp://www.example.com/smokeping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the URL is as you set up in Apache above.\n\n\nThere may be instances where you have multiple VLANs where it is not possible to have a single Smokeping instance graph latency for all of them. Particularly as the Smokeping daemon for a given VLAN needs to have an interface / IP address on that VLAN.\n\n\nINEX has such a situation where we have a regional exchange, \nINEX Cork\n, that is located in a different city to the main INEX LANs and IXP Manager. In this situation, you can configure Smokeping URL overrides on a per VLAN basis by creating a file called \n$IXPROOT/config/grapher_smokeping_overrides.php\n which returns an array as follows:\n\n\n?php\n\n\n\nreturn\n \n[\n\n\n    \nper_vlan_urls\n \n=\n \n[\n\n        \n2\n \n=\n \nhttp://www.example.com/smokeping\n,\n\n        \n4\n \n=\n \nhttp://www.example2.com/smokeping\n,\n\n    \n],\n\n\n\n];\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the array index (\n2\n and \n4\n in the above example) is the VLAN DB ID as explained above.\n\n\nAny VLANs without a specific override configured in this way will fall back to the \nGRAPHER_BACKEND_SMOKEPING_URL\n setting.\n\n\nViewing Smokeping in IXP Manager\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWhen configured correctly, there will be a latency button available (clock icon) in the member graphs in both the member and admin sections.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSee \nissue #122\n for a discussion on Ubuntu installation and diagnosing issues in general (relates to IXP Manager v3 but may still be useful).\n\n\nIXP Manager will call something like the following to fetch graphs from Smokeping:\n\n\nfile_get_contents( \nhttps://www.example.com/smokeping/?.....\n )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should see these requests to Smokeping in your Smokeping web server log files. Find these and compare them to the URLs that Smokeping itself generates for its own display of the images to ensure you have everything - and especially the Smokeping URL in IXP configuration set up correctly.\n\n\nAlso, try testing these URLs directly on the IXP Manager server via:\n\n\nphp -r \necho file_get_contents( \nhttps://...\n );",

Any VLANs without a specific override configured in this way will fall back to the  GRAPHER_BACKEND_SMOKEPING_URL  setting.",

This means that ingress sflow accounting should be enabled on all edge ports, but should not be enabled on any of the core ports.  This approach ensures that all packets entering or leaving the IXP are counted exactly once, when they enter the IXP fabric.\n\n\nAll the switches at the IXP should be configured to send sflow packets to the IP address of your sflow collector.  This will probably be the same server that you use for your IXP Manager sflow peer-to-peer graphing.\n\n\nIf sflow is enabled on any of the core ports or sflow is enabled in both directions (ingress + egress), traffic will be double-counted and this will lead to incorrect graphs.\n\n\nEach switch on the network sends sampled sflow packets to an sflow collector.  These packets are processed by the \"sflowtool\" command, which converts into an easily-parseable ascii format.  IXP Manager provides a script to read the output of the sflowtool command, correlate this against the IXP database and to use this to build up a matrix of traffic flows which are then exported to an RRD database.\n\n\nThe RRD files are stored on disk and can be accessed by using the sflow graphing system included in IXP Manager.\n\n\nSflow on Switches\n\uf0c1\n\n\nMany vendors support sflow, but some do not.  There is a \npartial list\n on the sflow web site.\n\n\nMost switches which support sflow will support ingress accounting, because this is what's required in \nRFC 3176\n. Some switches (e.g. Dell Force10 running older software) only support egress sflow.  If you use these on your IXP alongside other switches which only support ingress sflow, then the sflow graphs will show twice the traffic in one direction for the p2p graphs and zero traffic in the other direction.  There is no way for IXP Manager to work around this problem.\n\n\nIf not all of the IXP edge ports are sflow capable, then sflow traffic data will be lost for these ports.  This means that some point-to-point traffic graphs will show up with zero traffic, and that the sflow aggregate graphs will be wrong.\n\n\nSflow uses data sampling.  This means that the results it produces are estimated projections, but on largee data sets, these projections tend to be statistically accurate.\n\n\nEach switch or switch port needs to be configured with an sflow sampling rate. The exact rate chosen will depend on the traffic levels on the switch, how powerful the switch management plane CPU is, and how much bandwidth is available for the switch management.\n\n\nOn a small setup with low levels of traffic (e.g. 100kpps), it would be sensible to leave the sampling rate low (e.g. 1:1024). Alternatively, a busy 100G port may need a sampling rate of  1:32768 may turn out to be too low if the port is seeing large numbers of packets.  If the switch or the entire network is handling very large quantities of traffic, this figure should be high enough that IXP ports with low quantities of traffic will still get good quality graphs, but low enough that the switch management CPU isn't trashed, and that packets are not dropped on the management ethernet port.\n\n\nSome switches have automatic rate-limiting built in for sflow data export.  The sampling rate needs to be chosen so that sflow data export rate limiting doesn't kick in.  If it does, samples will be lost and this will cause graph inaccuracies.\n\n\nSwitch Implementation Limitations\n\uf0c1\n\n\nNetflow\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIXP Manager does not support netflow and support is not on the roadmap. This is because most netflow implementations do not export mac address information, which means that they cannot provide workable mac layer peer-to-peer statistics.\n\n\nCisco Switches\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOf Cisco's entire product range, only the Nexus 3000 and Nexus 9000 product range support sflow. Also, the sflow support on the Cisco Nexus 3k range is crippled due to the NX-OS software implementation, which forces ingress+egress sflow to be configured on specified ports rather than ingress-only.  Functional accounting requires ingress-only or egress-only sflow to be configured on a per-port basis: ingress + egress causes double-counting of packets.  It may be possible to work around this limitation using the broadcom shell using something like the following untested configuration:\n\n\nn3k# conf t\nn3k(config)# feature sflow\nn3k(config)# sflow data-source interface Ethernet1/1\nn3k(config)# ^Z\nn3k# test hardware internal bcm-usd bcm-diag-shell\nAvailable Unit Numbers: 0\nbcm-shell.0\n PortSampRate xe0 4096 0\nbcm-shell.0\n PortSampRate xe0\n xe0:   ingress: 1 out of 4096 packets, egress: not sampling,\nbcm-shell.0\n quit\nn3k#\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this command is not reboot persistent, and any time a TIX24X is rebooted, the command needs to be re-entered manually.  Note also that this configuration is untested.\n\n\nBrocade TurboIron 24X\n\uf0c1\n\n\nBy default a TIX24X will export 100 sflow records per second.  This can be changed using the following command:\n\n\nSSH@Switch# dm device-command 2762233\nSSH@Switch# tor modreg CPUPKTMAXBUCKETCONFIG(3) PKT_MAX_REFRESH=0xHHHH\n\n\n\n\n\n... where HHHH is the hex representation of the number of sflow records per second.  INEX has done some very primitive usage profiling which suggests that going above ~3000 sflow records per second will trash the management CPU too hard, so we use PKT_MAX_REFRESH=0x0BB8.  Note that this command is not reboot persistent, and any time a TIX24X is rebooted, the command needs to be re-entered manually.\n\n\nDell Force10\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEarlier versions of FTOS only support egress sflow, but support for ingress sflow was added in 2014.  If you intend to deploy IXP Manager sflow accounting on a Dell F10 switch, then you should upgrade to a software release which supports ingress sflow.\n\n\nCumulus Linux\n\uf0c1\n\n\nCumulus Linux uses hsflowd, which does not allow the operator to enable or disable sflow on a per-port basis, nor does it permit the operator to configure ports to use ingress-only sflow.  This configuration needs to be handled using the \n/usr/lib/cumulus/portsamp\n command, which is not reboot persistent.  It is strongly recommended to handle this configuration using orchestration, as it is not feasible to manually maintain this configuration.\n\n\nFanout\n\uf0c1\n\n\nConfiguring sflowtool fan-out\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe sflow data from all the IXP switches will normally be directed at a single sflow collector.  Often it is useful to have multiple copies of this sflow data stream so that the sflow data can be processed in different ways.\n\n\nIXP Manager uses sflow data for two separate components:\n\n\n\n\npoint-to-point ixp traffic graphs\n\n\ndetecting BGP live sessions on the exchange and using the info to update the peering matrix\n\n\n\n\nThis means that IXP Manager needs two separate sflow feeds.  This can be achieved by using the \nsflowtool\n fanout facility, which sends an exact copy of all incoming sflow records to a list of destinations.  For example, the following command listens for incoming sflow data on port 6343 and send three copies out.  Two copies are directed to different ports on the same server, on ports 5500 and 5501.  The third copy is sent to 192.0.2.20, port 6343.\n\n\n# sflowtool -4 -p 6343 -f 127.0.0.1/5500 -f 127.0.0.1/5501 -f 192.0.2.20/6343\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example could be used for handling P2P traffic graphs and BGP session detection on one machine, while sending a third sflow data feed to a separate server for IXP development or debugging.  The two local sflow feeds can be read using \nsflowtool\n:\n\n\n# sflowtool -4 -p 5500 -l\n# sflowtool -4 -p 5501 -l\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nsflowtool\n fanout daemon should be started by the normal operating system daemon startup mechanism, e.g. script in a \nrc.d\n or \ninit.d\n directory, or by a manual entry in \n/etc/rc.local\n.\n\n\nIf running \nsflowtool\n version 3.23 or greater, it is important to use the \n-4\n command-line parameter in sflowtool because otherwise it will listen on both ipv4 and ipv6 sockets. If you have an \nsflowtool\n process attempting to listen on a wildcard socket, it will stop other \nsflowtool\n processes from starting.",

The source code can be found on Github:  https://github.com/sflow/sflowtool.\n\n\nOnce the required packages are installed, the IXP Manager peer-to-peer graphing system can be configured as follows:\n\n\n\n\nClone the IXP Manager installation using \ngit clone https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager /srv/ixpmanager\n.\n\n\nCheck what perl libraries need to be installed using the \ntools/runtime/check-perl-dependencies.pl\n command.  These libraries will need to be manually installed.\n\n\nInstall the IXP Manager perl library in the \ntools/perl-lib/IXPManager\n directory (\nperl Makefile.PL; make install\n)\n\n\nconfigure and start \nrrdcached\n.  We recommend using journaled mode with the \n-P FLUSH,UPDATE -m 0666 -l unix:/var/run/rrdcached.sock\n options enabled.  Note that these options allow uncontrolled write access to the RRD files from anyone on the sflow machine, so precautions should be taken to limit access to this server to ensure that this cannot be abused.\n\n\n\n\nOn FreeBSD it is advisable to set \nnet.inet.udp.blackhole=1\n in \n/etc/sysctl.conf\n, to stop the kernel from replying to unknown sflow packets with an ICMP unreachable reply.\n\n\nixpmanager.conf\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe following sflow parameters must be set in the \nixp\n section:\n\n\n\n\nsflow_rrdcached\n: set to 0 or 1, depending on whether you want to use rrdcached or not.\n\n\nsflowtool\n: the location of the sflowtool binary.\n\n\nsflowtool_opts\n: command-line options to pass to sflowtool\n\n\nsflow_rrddir\n: the directory where all the sflow .rrd files will be stored.\n\n\napikey\n: a valid API key.

E.g. if you log into IXP Manager using \nhttp://www.example.com/ixp/\n, then \napibaseurl\n will be \nhttp://www.example.com/ixp/api/v4\n.\n\n\n\n\nNote that the \n section of \nixpmanager.conf\n will need to be configured either if you are running \nupdate-l2database.pl\n or the sflow BGP peering matrix system on the same server as the p2p sflow system.\n\n\nAn example ixpmanager.conf might look like this:\n\n\nsql\n\n        dbase_type      = mysql\n        dbase_database  = ixpmanager\n        dbase_username  = ixpmanager_user\n        dbase_password  = blahblah\n        dbase_hostname  = sql.example.com\n\n/sql\n\n\n\nixp\n\n        sflowtool = /usr/bin/sflowtool\n        sflowtool_opts = -4 -p 6343 -l\n        sflow_rrdcached = 1\n        sflow_rrddir = /data/ixpmatrix\n        apikey = APIKeyFromIXPManager\n        apibaseurl = http://www.example.com/ixp/api/v4\n\n/ixp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis file should be placed in \n/usr/local/etc/ixpmanager.conf\n\n\nStarting sflow-to-rrd-handler\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe \ntools/runtime/sflow/sflow-to-rrd-handler\n command processes the output from sflowtool and injects it into the RRD archive.

This means that the sflow server must run a web server (e.g. Apache), and the IXP Manager GUI must be configured with the URL of the RRD archive on the sflow server.\n\n\nAssuming that \nixpmanager.conf\n is configured to use \n/data/ixpmatrix\n for the RRD directory, these files can be server over HTTP using the following Apache configuration:\n\n\nAlias /grapher-sflow /data/ixpmatrix\n\nDirectory \n/data/ixpmatrix\n\n        Options None\n        AllowOverride None\n\n/Directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IXP Manager \n.env\n file must be configured with parameters both to enable sflow and to provide the front-end with the HTTP URL of the back-end server.  Assuming that the sflow p2p server has IP address 10.0.0.1, then the following lines should be added to \n.env\n:\n\n\nGRAPHER_BACKENDS=\nmrtg|sflow|smokeping\n\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_SFLOW_ENABLED=true\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_SFLOW_ROOT=\nhttp://10.0.0.1/grapher-sflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRRD Requirements\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEach IXP edge port will have 4 separate RRD files for recording traffic to each other participant on the same VLAN on the IXP fabric: ipv4 bytes, ipv6 bytes, ipv4 packets and ipv6 packets.  This means that the number of RRD files grows very quickly as the number of IXP participants increases.  Roughly speaking, for every N participants at the IXP, there will be about 4*N^2 RRD files.  As this number can create extremely high I/O requirements on even medium sized exchanges, IXP Manager requires that \nrrdcached\n is used.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere are plenty of things which could go wrong in a way which would stop the sflow mechanism from working properly.\n\n\n\n\nthe Mac Address table in IXP manager is populated correctly with all customer MAC addresses using the \nupdate-l2database.pl\n script\n\n\nensuring that all switch ports are set up correctly in IXP Manager, i.e. Core ports and Peering ports are configured as such\n\n\nensuring that sflow accounting is configured on peering ports and is disabled on all core ports\n\n\nensuring that sflow accounting is as ingress-only\n\n\nUsing Arista / Cisco / Dell F10 kit with LAGs?  Make sure you configure the port channel name in the Advanced Options section of the customer's virtual interface port configuration.\n\n\nif the \nsflow-to-rrd-handler\n script crashes, this may indicate that the back-end filesystem is overloaded.  Installing rrdcached is a first step here.  If it crashes with rrdcached enabled, then you need more disk I/O (SSDs, etc).\n\n\nit is normal to see about 5% difference between sflow stats and mrtg stats.  These differences are hardware and software implementation dependent.  Every switch manufacturer does things slightly differently.\n\n\nif there is too much of a difference between the sflow p2p individual aggregate stats and the port stats from the main graphing system, it might be that the switch is throttling sflow samples.  It will be necessary to check the maximum sflow pps rate on the switch processor, compare that with the pps rate in the Switch Statistics graphs and work out the switch process pps throughput on the basis of the sflow sample rate.   Increasing the sflow sampling ration may help, at the cost of less accurate graphs for peering sessions with low traffic levels.\n\n\n\n\nFreeBSD, really?\n\uf0c1\n\n\nNo.  All of this runs perfectly well on Ubuntu (or your favourite Linux distribution).\n\n\nINEX runs its sflow back-end on FreeBSD because we found that the UFS filesystem performs better than the Linux ext3 filesystem when handling large RRD archives.  If you run \nrrdcached\n, it's unlikely that you will run into performance problems.  If you do, you can engineer around them by running the RRD archive on a PCIe SSD.",

While that repository is not for development purposes, the terminology and container descriptions apply here also.\n\n\nTL;DR Guide to Get Docker Running\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIf you want to get IXP Manager with Docker up and running quickly, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\nInstall Docker (see: \nhttps://www.docker.com/community-edition\n)\n\n\n\n\nClone IXP Manager to a directory:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager.git ixpmanager\n\ncd \nixpmanager\n\n\n\n3. Copy the stock Docker/IXP Manager configuration file and default database:\n\n\ncp .env.docker .env\ncp tools/docker/containers/mysql/docker.sql.dist tools/docker/containers/mysql/docker.sql\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpin up the Docker containers\n\n\ndocker-compose -p ixpm up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess IXP Manager on: http://localhost:8880/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog in with one of the following username / passwords:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin user: \ndocker / docker01\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Admin: \nas112admin / as112admin\n\n\nCustomer User: \nas112user / as112user\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Overview\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs the IXP Manager ecosystem grows, it becomes harder and harder to maintain ubiquitous development environments. Docker is ideally suited to solving these issues.\n\n\nThe multi-container Docker environment for developing IXP Manager builds an IXP Manager system which includes:\n\n\n\n\na custom MySQL database container (from \nmysql/5.7\n).\n\n\nthe complete IXP Manager application build on the \nphp/7.0-apache\n base. This has been preconfigured with some customers, routers, switches, etc. to match the following containers.\n\n\ntwo emulated switches via SNMP endpoints (using the excellent \nSNMP Agent Simulator\n via \ntandrup/snmpsim\n);\n\n\na mail trap with a web-based frontend to capture and analyse all emails sent by IXP Manager (thanks to \nschickling/mailcatcher\n).\n\n\na mrtg container to query the switches and build up mrtg log files / graphs (via \ncityhawk/mrtg\n).\n\n\na Bird-based route server pre-configured for 3 x IPv4 and 2 x IPv6 sessions. This also includes our \nBird's Eye\n looking glass which has been integrated into \nrs1\n container and configured into the IXP Manager container.\n\n\nfive Bird-based route server clients complete with routes and a route server session.\n\n\n\n\nUseful Docker Commands\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe following are a list of Docker commands that are useful in general but also specifically for the IXP Manager Docker environment.\n\n\nNote that in our examples, we set the Docker project name to \nixpm\n and so that prefix is used in some of the below. We also assume that only one IXP Manager Docker environments is running and so we complate Docker container names with \n_1\n.\n\n\n# show all running containers\n\ndocker ps\n\n\n# show all containers - running and stopped\n\ndocker ps -a\n\n\n# stop a container:\n\ndocker stop \ncontainer\n\n\n\n# start a container:\n\ndocker start \ncontainer\n\n\n\n# we create a \nixpmanager\n network. Sometimes you need to delete this when\n\n\n# stopping / starting the environment\n\ndocker network rm ixpm_ixpmanager\n\n\n# you can copy files into a docker container via:\n\ndocker cp test.sql ixmp_mysql_1:/tmp\n\n# where \nixmp_mysql_1\n is the container name.\n\n\n# reverse it to copy a file out:\n\ndocker cp ixmp_mysql_1:/tmp/dump.sql .\n\n\n# I use two useful aliases for stopping and removing all containers:\n\n\nalias \ndocker-stop-all\n=\ndocker stop $(docker ps -a -q)\n\n\nalias \ndocker-rm-all\n=\ndocker rm $(docker ps -a -q)\n\n\n\n# You can also remove all unused (unattached) volumes:\n\ndocker volume prune\n\n# WARNING: you might want to check what will be deleted with:\n\ndocker volume ls -f \ndangling\n=\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment Use\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs above, please note that in our examples, we set the Docker project name to \nixpm\n and so that prefix is used in some of the below. We also assume that only one IXP Manager Docker environments is running and so we complete Docker container names with \n_1\n.\n\n\nFor most routine development use, you only need two containers usually:\n\n\ndocker-compose -p ixpm up mysql www\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are sending emails as part of your development process, include the mail catcher:\n\n\ndocker-compose -p ixpm up mysql www mailcatcher\n\n\n\n\n\nMySQL Database\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWhen the mysql container builds, it pre-populates the database with the contents of the SQL file found at \ntools/docker/containers/mysql/docker.sql\n. This is not present by default and is ignored by Git (to ensure you do not accidentally commit a production database!).\n\n\nA default SQL database is bundled and should be placed in this location via:\n\n\ncp tools/docker/containers/mysql/docker.sql.dist tools/docker/containers/mysql/docker.sql\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can put your own database here also. If you do, you will need to rebuilt the mysql contain:\n\n\ndocker-compose build mysql\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can access the MySQL database via:\n\n\ndocker \nexec\n -it ixpm_mysql_1 mysql -i ixpmanager\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you can get shell access to the container with:\n\n\ndocker \nexec\n -it ixpm_mysql_1 bash\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also connect to the MySQL server from your local machine using tools such as the standard MySQL client, \nTablePlus\n or \nSequel Pro\n with the following settings:\n\n\nmysql --protocol\n=\nTCP --port \n33060\n -u root\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Server\n\uf0c1\n\n\nNote that the \nwww\n container mounts the IXP Manager development directory under \n/srv/ixpmanager\n. This means all local code changes are immediately reflected on the Docker web server.\n\n\nThe Dockerfile used to build the \nwww\n container can be found at \ntools/docker/containers/www/Dockerfile\n.\n\n\nYou can access the container with:\n\n\ndocker \nexec\n -it ixpm_www_1 bash\n\n\n\n\n\nMailcatcher\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWe include a mailcatcher container which catches all emails IXP Manager sends and displays them on a web frontend. Ensure this container is started by either:\n\n\n# start all containers:\n\ndocker-compose -p ixpm up\n\n# start mailcatcher with (at least) mysql and www:\n\ndocker-compose -p ixpm up mysql www mailcatcher\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \n.env.docker\n config contains the following SMTP / mail settings which ensure emails get send to the mailcatcher:\n\n\nMAIL_HOST=172.30.201.11\nMAIL_PORT=1025\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can then view emails sent on: http://localhost:1080/\n\n\nEmulating Switches\n\uf0c1\n\n\nixpm_switch1_1\n and \nixpm_switch2_1\n emulate switches by replaying SNMP dumps from real INEX switches (with some sanitisation). The OIDs for traffic have been replaced with a dynamic function to give varying values.\n\n\nFrom the \nwww\n container, you can interact with these via:\n\n\n$ \ndocker \nexec\n -it ixpm_www_1 bash\n\n# ping switch1\n\n...\n\n64\n bytes from switch1 \n(\n172.30.201.60\n)\n: \nicmp_seq\n=\n1\n \nttl\n=\n64\n \ntime\n=\n0.135 ms\n...\n\n# ping switch2\n\n...\n\n64\n bytes from switch2 \n(\n172.30.201.61\n)\n: \nicmp_seq\n=\n1\n \nttl\n=\n64\n \ntime\n=\n0.150 ms\n...\n\n\n\n# snmpwalk -On -v 2c -c switch1 switch1 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0\n\n.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 \n=\n STRING: \nswitch1\n\n\n# snmpwalk -On -v 2c -c switch2 switch2 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0\n\n.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 \n=\n STRING: \nswitch2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll note from the above that the hostnames \nswitch1\n and \nswitch2\n work from the \nwww\n container. Note also that the SNMP community is the hostname (\nswitch1\n or \nswitch2\n as appropriate).\n\n\nThe packaged database only contains \nswitch1\n. This allows you can add the second switch via http://localhost:8880/switch/add-by-snmp by setting the hostname and community to \nswitch2\n.\n\n\nIf you want to add new customers for testing, add \nswitch2\n and then use interfaces \nEthernet 2, 8, 13\n and \n6 and 7\n as a lag as these have been preset to provide dynamic stats.\n\n\nRoute Server and Clients\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe containers include a working route server (\nixpm_rs1_1\n) with 3 IPv4 clients (\nixpm_cust-as112_1\n, \nixpm_cust-as42_1\n, \nixpm_cust-as1213_1\n) and and 2 IPv6 clients (\nixpm_cust-as1213-v6_1\n, \nixpm_cust-as25441-v6_1\n). IXP Manager also includes a working looking glass for this with Bird's Eye installed on the route server.\n\n\nYou can access the Bird BGP clients on the five sample customers using the following examples:\n\n\n# access Bird command line interface:\n\ndocker \nexec\n -it ixpm_cust-as112_1 birdc\n\n\n# run a specific Bird command\n\ndocker \nexec\n -it ixpm_cust-as112_1 birdc show protocols\n\n\n\n\n\nThe route server runs an IPv4 and an IPv6 daemon. These can be accessed via the looking glass at http://127.0.0.1:8880/lg or on the command line via:\n\n\n# ipv4 daemon:\n\ndocker \nexec\n -it ixpm_rs1_1 birdc -s /var/run/bird/bird-rs1-ipv4.ctl\n\n\n# ipv6 daemon:\n\ndocker \nexec\n -it ixpm_rs1_1 birdc6 -s /var/run/bird/bird-rs1-ipv6.ctl\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this container, Bird's Eye can be found at \n/srv/birdseye\n with the web server config under \n/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf\n.\n\n\nWe include the IXP Manager scripts for updating the route server configuration and reconfiguring Bird:\n\n\n# get shell access to the container\n\ndocker \nexec\n -it ixpm_rs1_1 bash\n\n\n# all scripts under the following directory\n\n\ncd\n /usr/local/sbin/\n\n\n# reconfigure both daemons:\n\n./api-reconfigure-all-v4.sh\n\n\n# reconfigure a specific daemon with verbosity:\n\n./api-reconfigure-v4.sh -d -h rs1-ipv4\n\n\n\n\n\nMrtg / Grapher\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFor developing / testing Grapher with Mrtg, we include a container that runs Mrtg via cron from a pre-configured \nmrtg.conf\n file.\n\n\nNB: please ensure to update the \nGRAPHER_BACKENDS\n option in \n.env\n so it includes \nmrtg\n as follows:\n\n\nGRAPHER_BACKENDS=\nmrtg|dummy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe configuration file matches the \ndocker.sql\n configuration and can be seen in the IXP Manager source directory at \ntools/docker/mrtg/mrtg.cfg\n.\n\n\nYou can access the Mrtg container via:\n\n\ndocker \nexec\n -it ixpm_mrtg_1 sh\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also install a script in the root directory of the container that will pull a new configuration from IXP Manager. Run it via:\n\n\ndocker \nexec\n -it ixpm_mrtg_1 sh\n\ncd\n /\n./update-mrtg-conf.sh\n\n\n# or without entering the container:\n\ndocker \nexec\n -it ixpm_mrtg_1 /update-mrtg-conf.sh\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will replace \n/etc/mrtg.conf\n for the next cron run. It also sets the configuration not to run as a daemon as cron is more useful for development.\n\n\nDev Tool Integrations\n\uf0c1\n\n\nNB: these tools and integrations are not IXP Manager specific but rather the typical Docker / PHP development tool chain. Please use support forums for the relevant sections / tools rather than contacting the IXP Manager developers directly.\n\n\nPHP Storm and Xdebug\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWe are big fans of \nPhpStorm\n at IXP Manager DevHQ. One key feature is PhpStorm's integration with PHP Xdebug. We of course also need this to work with Docker.\n\n\nSome background information on Xdebug is provided below but you are expected to be familiar with \nthe Xdebug documentation on remote debugging\n.\n\n\nThe way interactive remote debugging works with Xdebug is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nEnable remote debugging on the PHP server (\nphp.ini\n settings on the \nwww\n container).\n\n\nYour browser, with a suitable plugin, includes a Xdebug parameter to signal you want remote debugging started for this request (either a GET, POST or Cookie setting).\n\n\nPHP Xdebug connects to the configured remote debugger \n(PhpStorm in our case)\n allowing you to set break points, step through instructions, view variable contents at a point in time, etc.\n\n\n\n\nTo get this working with Docker, we need to work through each of these steps.\n\n\n1. Enable Remote Debugging in the Docker Container\n\n\nIf you examine the \nwww\n container Dockerfile in the IXP Manager source under \ntools/docker/containers/www/Dockerfile\n, you will see that we:\n\n\n\n\nbuild the PHP Xdebug extension (\npecl install xdebug\n).\n\n\nconfigure in the container file \n/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/local-ixpmanager-xdebug.ini\n as follows:\n\n\n\n\n[xdebug]\nzend_extension=/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20151012/xdebug.so\nxdebug.remote_enable=1\nxdebug.remote_port=9001\nxdebug.remote_autostart=0\nxdebug.idekey=PHPSTORM\nxdebug.profiler_enable=0\nxdebug.profiler_enable_trigger=1\nxdebug.profiler_output_dir=/srv/ixpmanager/storage/tmp\nxdebug.auto_trace=0\nxdebug.trace_enable_trigger=1\nxdebug.trace_output_dir=/srv/ixpmanager/storage/tmp\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the \nzend_extension\n may change as it is dynamically set by the build script. We also chose port 9001 rather than the default of 9000 \ndue to local conflicts with common tool chains\n.\n\n\nThe \none key element that is missing in the INI is the remote debugger IP address\n. This needs to be set to your development computer's LAN address (there are other options but this works best in practice). Once you know this address (say it's \n192.0.2.23\n), set the following in the \n${IXPROOT}/.env\n:\n\n\n# For PHP xdebug, put in the IP address of your host\nDOCKER_XDEBUG_CONFIG_REMOTE_HOST=192.0.2.23\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you start the Docker environment from \n$IXPROOT\n using \ndocker-compose\n with something like:\n\n\ncd $IXPROOT\ndocker-compose -p ixpm up mysql www\n\n\n\n\n\nthen \ndocker-compose\n will use this setting from the \n.env\n file and it will be passed through the Xdebug.\n\n\n2. Install a Xdebug Plugin on Your Browser\n\n\nSome recommended plugins from \nthe Xdebug documentation on remote debugging\n are these: \nFirefox\n, \nChrome\n, \nSafari\n. It can also be enabled manually using a GET parameter - see the Xdebug documentation.\n\n\nThe only required parameter is the session key. For PhpStorm, the default is \nPHPSTORM\n unless you have configured it differently (see step 3 below).\n\n\nThe PHP Xdebug browser plugins allow you to enable debugging on a per request basis. See the Firefox link above to the plugin homepage for screenshots (as of 2018-01 at least).\n\n\n3. Configure PhpStorm\n\n\nPhpStorm have \ntheir own documentation for Xdebug\n. The short version to match the above two steps is:\n\n\n\n\nin PhpStorm, open \nPreferences\n\n\nchoose \nLanguages \n Frameworks\n -\n \nPHP\n -\n \nDebug\n.\n\n\nin the \nXdebug\n section:\n\n\nset the port to \n9001\n\n\ncheck \nCan accept external connections\n\n\napply these changes\n\n\n\n\nYou now need to create a \nRun/Debug Configuration\n. This is so you can map file paths on the remote system (\nwww\n container) to your local development files:\n\n\n\n\nunder the\nRun\n menu, select \nEdit Configurations...\n\n\nin the resulting \nRun/Debug Configurations\n window, select the 'add' button on the top left\n\n\nchoose to add a new \nPHP Remote Debug\n configuration\n\n\nconfigure the directory mapping as per this screenshot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyou should see this new configuration selected on the top right (if not, please refer to PhpStorm documentation)\n\n\nunder the \nRun\n menu, click \nStart listening for PHP Debug connections\n\n\n\n\nFor testing, set a break point in \npublic/index.php\n and access your development IXP Manager using your new browser plugin. You should be able to step through each statement and - presuming your mappings are correctly set up - step into any file in the project.\n\n\nProfiling and Function Traces\n\n\nYou may have noticed in the Xdebug configuration above, we have allowed for the triggering of function traces and profiling also. The browser plugins should support these - certainly the Firefox one does \n(leave the trigger key blank in both cases)\n.\n\n\nWhen you request an IXP Manager page via Firefox with profiling enabled, you will find the \ncachegrind\n file in \n$IXPROOT/storage/tmp\n on your own system You can then view this in PhpStorm via the menu \nTools -\n Analyze Xdebug Profiler Snapshot...\n.\n\n\nFunction traces can be found in the same directory - these are just text files.",

            "text": "We are big fans of  PhpStorm  at IXP Manager DevHQ. One key feature is PhpStorm's integration with PHP Xdebug. We of course also need this to work with Docker.  Some background information on Xdebug is provided below but you are expected to be familiar with  the Xdebug documentation on remote debugging .  The way interactive remote debugging works with Xdebug is as follows:   Enable remote debugging on the PHP server ( php.ini  settings on the  www  container).  Your browser, with a suitable plugin, includes a Xdebug parameter to signal you want remote debugging started for this request (either a GET, POST or Cookie setting).  PHP Xdebug connects to the configured remote debugger  (PhpStorm in our case)  allowing you to set break points, step through instructions, view variable contents at a point in time, etc.   To get this working with Docker, we need to work through each of these steps.  1. Enable Remote Debugging in the Docker Container  If you examine the  www  container Dockerfile in the IXP Manager source under  tools/docker/containers/www/Dockerfile , you will see that we:   build the PHP Xdebug extension ( pecl install xdebug ).  configure in the container file  /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/local-ixpmanager-xdebug.ini  as follows:   [xdebug]\nzend_extension=/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20151012/xdebug.so\nxdebug.remote_enable=1\nxdebug.remote_port=9001\nxdebug.remote_autostart=0\nxdebug.idekey=PHPSTORM\nxdebug.profiler_enable=0\nxdebug.profiler_enable_trigger=1\nxdebug.profiler_output_dir=/srv/ixpmanager/storage/tmp\nxdebug.auto_trace=0\nxdebug.trace_enable_trigger=1\nxdebug.trace_output_dir=/srv/ixpmanager/storage/tmp  Note that the  zend_extension  may change as it is dynamically set by the build script. We also chose port 9001 rather than the default of 9000  due to local conflicts with common tool chains .  The  one key element that is missing in the INI is the remote debugger IP address . This needs to be set to your development computer's LAN address (there are other options but this works best in practice). Once you know this address (say it's  192.0.2.23 ), set the following in the  ${IXPROOT}/.env :  # For PHP xdebug, put in the IP address of your host\nDOCKER_XDEBUG_CONFIG_REMOTE_HOST=192.0.2.23  When you start the Docker environment from  $IXPROOT  using  docker-compose  with something like:  cd $IXPROOT\ndocker-compose -p ixpm up mysql www  then  docker-compose  will use this setting from the  .env  file and it will be passed through the Xdebug.  2. Install a Xdebug Plugin on Your Browser  Some recommended plugins from  the Xdebug documentation on remote debugging  are these:  Firefox ,  Chrome ,  Safari . It can also be enabled manually using a GET parameter - see the Xdebug documentation.  The only required parameter is the session key. For PhpStorm, the default is  PHPSTORM  unless you have configured it differently (see step 3 below).  The PHP Xdebug browser plugins allow you to enable debugging on a per request basis. See the Firefox link above to the plugin homepage for screenshots (as of 2018-01 at least).  3. Configure PhpStorm  PhpStorm have  their own documentation for Xdebug . The short version to match the above two steps is:   in PhpStorm, open  Preferences  choose  Languages   Frameworks  -   PHP  -   Debug .  in the  Xdebug  section:  set the port to  9001  check  Can accept external connections  apply these changes   You now need to create a  Run/Debug Configuration . This is so you can map file paths on the remote system ( www  container) to your local development files:   under the Run  menu, select  Edit Configurations...  in the resulting  Run/Debug Configurations  window, select the 'add' button on the top left  choose to add a new  PHP Remote Debug  configuration  configure the directory mapping as per this screenshot:     you should see this new configuration selected on the top right (if not, please refer to PhpStorm documentation)  under the  Run  menu, click  Start listening for PHP Debug connections   For testing, set a break point in  public/index.php  and access your development IXP Manager using your new browser plugin. You should be able to step through each statement and - presuming your mappings are correctly set up - step into any file in the project.  Profiling and Function Traces  You may have noticed in the Xdebug configuration above, we have allowed for the triggering of function traces and profiling also. The browser plugins should support these - certainly the Firefox one does  (leave the trigger key blank in both cases) .  When you request an IXP Manager page via Firefox with profiling enabled, you will find the  cachegrind  file in  $IXPROOT/storage/tmp  on your own system You can then view this in PhpStorm via the menu  Tools -  Analyze Xdebug Profiler Snapshot... .  Function traces can be found in the same directory - these are just text files.",

You can change this by setting the following property on your implementation:\n\n\n?php\n\n\n/**\n\n\n * The minimum privileges required to access this controller.\n\n\n *\n\n\n * If you set this to less than the superuser, you need to manage privileges and access\n\n\n * within your own implementation yourself.\n\n\n *\n\n\n * @var int\n\n\n */\n\n\npublic\n \nstatic\n \n$minimum_privilege\n \n=\n \nUserEntity\n::\nAUTH_SUPERUSER\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you set this to less than the superuser, you need to manage privileges and access within your own implementation yourself.\n\n\nThis is normally handled in a number of ways:\n\n\n\n\ndedicated \nRequest\n object utilising the \nauthorize()\n method;\n\n\nadditional middleware;\n\n\nper action basis;\n\n\nin \nfeInit()\n\n\n\n\nThe \nfeInit()\n method would normally look something like the following:\n\n\n?php\n\n\n// phpunit / artisan trips up here without the cli test:\n\n\nif\n(\n \nphp_sapi_name\n()\n \n!==\n \ncli\n \n)\n \n{\n\n\n    \n// custom access controls:\n\n    \nswitch\n(\n \nAuth\n::\ncheck\n()\n \n?\n \nAuth\n::\nuser\n()\n-\ngetPrivs\n()\n \n:\n \nUserEntity\n::\nAUTH_PUBLIC\n \n)\n \n{\n\n        \ncase\n \nUserEntity\n::\nAUTH_SUPERUSER\n:\n\n            \nbreak\n;\n\n\n        \ncase\n \nUserEntity\n::\nAUTH_CUSTUSER\n:\n\n            \nswitch\n(\n \nRoute\n::\ncurrent\n()\n-\ngetName\n()\n \n)\n \n{\n\n                \ncase\n \nLayer2AddressController@forVlanInterface\n:\n\n                    \nbreak\n;\n\n\n                \ndefault\n:\n\n                    \n$this\n-\nunauthorized\n();\n\n            \n}\n\n            \nbreak\n;\n\n\n        \ndefault\n:\n\n            \n$this\n-\nunauthorized\n();\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \n$this-\nunauthorized( $url = '', $code = 302 )\n calls \nabort()\n with the given redirect code and URL. The default parameters will \ndo the right thing\n.\n\n\nRouting\n\uf0c1\n\n\nRoutes are explicitly defined in Laravel. The \nDoctrine2Frontend\n class sets up the standard routes automatically once you add the following to your \nroutes/web.php\n (or as appropriate) file on a per implementation basis. E.g. for the \nInfrastructure\n implementation, we add to \nroutes/web-doctrine2frontend.php\n:\n\n\n?php\n\n\nIXP\\Http\\Controllers\\InfrastructureController\n::\nroutes\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that by placing the above in \nroutes/web-doctrine2frontend.php\n, you ensure the appropriate middleware is attached.\n\n\nThis \nroutes()\n function determines the route prefix using kebab case of the controller name. That is to say: if the controller is \nCustKitController\n, the determined prefix is \ncust-kit\n. You can override this by setting a \n$route_prefix\n class constant in your implementation.\n\n\nThe standard routes added (using \ninfrastructure\n as an example) are:\n\n\n\n\nGET \ninfrastructure/add\n\n\nGET \ninfrastructure/edit/{id}\n\n\nGET \ninfrastructure/list\n\n\nGET \ninfrastructure/view/{id}\n\n\nPOST \ninfrastructure/delete/{id}\n\n\nPOST \ninfrastructure/store\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to create your own additional routes, create a function as follows in your implementation:\n\n\n?php\n\n\npublic\n \nstatic\n \nfunction\n \nadditionalRoutes\n(\n \n$route_prefix\n \n)\n \n{}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd add routes (using the normal \nRoute::get()\n / \n::post()\n / etc Laravel methods).\n\n\nIf you want to completely change the routes, just override the \npublic static function routes() {}\n function.\n\n\nView Templates\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAll the common view templates for thss functionality can be found in \nresources/views/frontend\n directory. You can override any of these with your own by creating a template of the same name and placing it under \nresources/views/xxx\n (or \nresources/skins/skinname/xxx\n) where \nxxx\n is the \nfeParams['viewFolderName']\n.\n\n\nRead Only\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIf your controller should be read only (list and view actions, no add, edit or delete) then set the following static member:\n\n\n?php\n\n\n/**\n\n\n * Is this a read only controller?\n\n\n *\n\n\n * @var boolean\n\n\n */\n\n\npublic\n \nstatic\n \n$read_only\n \n=\n \ntrue\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActions\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEach of the typical CRUD actions will be described here.\n\n\nNB: the best documentation is sometimes the code. Check out the above routes file (\nroutes/web-doctrine2frontend.php\n) and examine some of the implemented controllers directly.\n\n\nList\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe list action is for listing the contents of a database table in a HTML / DataTables view.\n\n\nThe only requirement of the list action is that the following abstract function is implemented:\n\n\n?php\n\n\n/**\n\n\n * Provide array of table rows for the list action (and view action)\n\n\n *\n\n\n * @param int $id The `id` of the row to load for `view` action. `null` if `list` action.\n\n\n * @return array\n\n\n */\n\n\nabstract\n \nprotected\n \nfunction\n \nlistGetData\n(\n \n$id\n \n=\n \nnull\n \n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA sample implementation for the infrastructure controller just calls a Doctrine2 repository function:\n\n\n?php\n\n\nprotected\n \nfunction\n \nlistGetData\n(\n \n$id\n \n=\n \nnull\n \n)\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nD2EM\n::\ngetRepository\n(\n \nInfrastructureEntity\n::\nclass\n \n)\n-\ngetAllForFeList\n(\n \n$this\n-\nfeParams\n,\n \n$id\n \n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table rows returned in the above array must be associatative arrays with keys matching the \nfeParams['listColumns']\n definition.\n\n\nThe list view template optionally includes other templates you can define (where \nxxx\n below is the \nfeParams['viewFolderName']\n):\n\n\n\n\nthe list view includes a JavaScript template \nresources/views/frontend/js/list\n which activates the DataTables, sets up sorting, etc. You can override this (and include the original if appropriate) if you want to add additional JS functionality.\n\n\nif the \nresources/views/xxx/list-preamble\n template exists, it is included just before the table.\n\n\nif the \nresources/views/xxx/list-postamble\n template exists, it is included just after the table.\n\n\nif the \nresources/views/xxx/list-head-override\n template exists, it will replace the \nthead\n element of the list table (\nexample\n).\n\n\nif the \nresources/views/xxx/list-head-override\n template exists, it will replace the \ntr\n elements of the list table (\nexample\n).\n\n\nif the \nresources/views/xxx/list-empty-message\n template exists, it will replace the the standard information box\nwhen a table is empty (\nexample\n).\n\n\n\n\nThe following hooks are available:\n\n\n\n\nprotected function preList():void {}\n - called before the list is displayed allowing you to add elements to the template, etc.\n\n\n\n\nView\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe view action is for showing a single database row identified by the id passed in the URL.\n\n\nThe only requirement of the view action is that the abstract function \nlistGetData( $id = null )\n as used by the list action has been correctly implemented to take an optional ID and return an array with a single element matching that ID.\n\n\nThe table rows returned in the above array must be associatative arrays with keys matching the \nfeParams['viewColumns']\n definition.\n\n\nThe list view template optionally includes other templates you can define (where \nxxx\n below is the \nfeParams['viewFolderName']\n):\n\n\n\n\nan optional JavaScript template \nresources/views/frontend/js/view\n.\n\n\nif the \nresources/views/xxx/view-preamble\n template exists, it is included just before the view panel.\n\n\nif the \nresources/views/xxx/view-postamble\n template exists, it is included just after the view panel.\n\n\nif the \nresources/views/xxx/view-row-override\n template exists, it will replace the \ntr\n element of the view (\nexample\n).\n\n\n\n\nCreate / Update Form\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe presentation of the create / update (also known as add / edit) page is discussed here.

In the case of edit, it tries to load the appropriate object from the database.\n\n\nif it's an edit operation, the \nFormer\n object is built up containing the existing objects details.\n\n\nyou can pass back any data you wish in the returned array and it will be available via \n$t-\nparams\n in the template. Note that \n$t-\nparams['data']\n is added later and contains the feParams object.\n\n\n\n\nThe next required element is building the actual \nFormer\n object for display. For this, you must create a custom \nresources/views/xxx/edit-form\n template.
