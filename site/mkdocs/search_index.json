Typically, this means some element of framework refresh(es) every couple of years and other more incremental package upgrades with minor version upgrades. As well as the obvious reasons for this, there is also the requirement to prevent developer apathy - insisting on legacy frameworks and packages that have been EOL'd provides a major stumbling block for bringing on new developers and contributors.\n\n\nThe current requirements for the web application are:\n\n\n\n\na Linux / BSD host.\n\n\nMariaDB / MySQL version 5.5.4 or later.\n\n\nApache / Nginx / etc.\n\n\nPHP \n= 7.0. \nNote that IXP Manager will not run on older versions of PHP.\n\n\nMemcached - optional but highly recommended.\n\n\n\n\nTo complete the installation using the included config/scripts, you will also need to have installed:\n\n\n\n\ngit - distributed revision control system (e.g.: \napt-get install git\n)\n\n\nmemcache extension module for PHP (e.g.: \napt-get install php-memcached\n)\n\n\nSNMP extension module for PHP (e.g.: \napt-get install php7.0-snmp\n)\n\n\nphp7.0-mbstring - may be built into the PHP core\n\n\nphp7.0-xml\n\n\nphp7.0-intl\n\n\nphp7.0-mysql\n\n\nphp7.0-mcrypt\n\n\nphp-rrd\n\n\n\n\nFor completeness, the IXP Manager installation script for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installs:\n\n\nsh\napt-get install apache2 php7.0 php7.0-intl php7.0-mysql php-rrd php7.0-cgi php7.0-cli  \\\n    php7.0-snmp php7.0-curl php7.0-mcrypt php-memcached libapache2-mod-php7.0          \\\n    mysql-server mysql-client php-mysql memcached snmp nodejs nodejs-legacy npm        \\\n    php7.0-mbstring php7.0-xml php-gettext bgpq3 php-memcache unzip php-zip git\n\n\nInstall Composer and Bower\n\n\nIXP Manager uses \nComposer\n to manage its PHP dependencies. First, download a copy of the composer.phar. Once you have the PHAR archive, you can either keep it in your local project directory or move to \n/usr/local/bin\n to use it globally on your system.\n\n\nThe installation script for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installs these via:\n\n\nIXPROOT=/srv/ixpmanager\n# ...\ncd $IXPROOT\nEXPECTED_SIGNATURE=$(wget https://composer.github.io/installer.sig -O - -q)\nphp -r \ncopy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');\n\nACTUAL_SIGNATURE=$(php -r \necho hash_file('SHA384', 'composer-setup.php');\n)\n\nif [ \n$EXPECTED_SIGNATURE\n = \n$ACTUAL_SIGNATURE\n ]; then\n    sudo -u www-data bash -c \nHOME=$IXPROOT \n cd $IXPROOT \n php composer-setup.php --quiet\n\n    rm $IXPROOT/composer-setup.php\n    # optional:\n    mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer\nelse\n    echo -e \n\\n\\nERROR: Invalid installer signature for composer installation\n\n    rm $IXPROOT/composer-setup.php\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n\n\n\nand:\n\n\nnpm install -g bower\n\n\n\n\nGet the IXP Manager Source\n\n\nThe code for IXP Manager is maintained on GitHub and the canonical repository is \ninex/IXP-Manager\n.\n\n\nLog into the server where you wish to install IXP Manager. Move to the directory where you wish to store the source (our examples use \n/srv/ixpmanager\n which we refer to as \n$IXPROOT\n). Note that it \nshould not\n be checked out into any web exposed directory (e.g. do not checkout to \n/var/www\n).\n\n\ncd /srv\ngit clone https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager.git ixpmanager\ncd $IXPROOT   # /srv/ixpmanager\ngit checkout master\n\n\n\n\nInitial Setup and Dependancies\n\n\nDependencies\n\n\nInstall the required PHP libraries and frontend CSS/JS packages:\n\n\ncd $IXPROOT\ncomposer install\nbower install\ncp .env.example .env\nphp artisan key:generate\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Setup\n\n\nUse whatever means you like to create a database and user for IXP Manager. For example:\n\n\nCREATE DATABASE `ixp` CHARACTER SET = 'utf8mb4' COLLATE = 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci';\nGRANT ALL ON `ixp`.* TO `ixp`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED BY '\npick a password!\n';\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\n\n\n\nThen edit \n$IXPROOT/.env\n and set the database options:\n\n\nDB_HOST=localhost\nDB_DATABASE=ixp\nDB_USERNAME=ixp\nDB_PASSWORD=password\n\n\n\n\nNow create the database schema:\n\n\nphp artisan doctrine:schema:create\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nEdit \n$IXPROOT/.env\n and review and set/change all parameters. Hopefully this is mostly documented or clear but please start a discussion on the mailing list if you have difficultly and we'll update this and the example file's documentation as appropriate.\n\n\nInitial Database Objects\n\n\nUsing the settings you edited in \n.env\n we'll create some database objects.

First Laravel: we'll essentially set defaults in \n$IXPROOT/.env\n which will be used by files in \n$IXPROOT/config\n. Feel free to look at those files and add \n.env\n parameters to suit your own environment.\n\n\nFirst, the application key needs to be set and unique. Execute the following command and you should see a similar output (but a different key):\n\n\nphp artisan key:generate\nApplication key [XjWtsiPl_CHANGE_ME_CHANGE_ME] set successfully.\n\n\n\n\nAdd the APP_KEY to the \n.env\n file by copying the key above:\n\n\nAPP_KEY=XjWtsiPl_CHANGE_ME_CHANGE_ME\n\n\n\n\nNB: Where possible, place local changes into \n.env\n rather than changing the config files as these files are under version control. See \nLaravel's documentation on this\n and email the mailing list for help.\n\n\nHere are some hints on what you might want to set:\n\n\n\n\nconfig/app.php\n\n\nSet: \nAPP_URL\n in \n$IXPROOT/.env\n.\n\n\nconfig/cache.php\n\n\nEither leave \nCACHE_DRIVER\n as \nfile\n or set otherwise in \n$IXPROOT/.env\n.\n\n\nconfig/identity.php\n\n\nCopy \nconfig/identity.php.dist\n to \nconfig/identity.php\n and edit for your IXP \n(essentially copy from your v3 application/configs/application.ini)\n.\n\n\nconfig/mail.php\n\n\nSet appropriate options for mail relay.

One of the changes is that the graphing directory structure and filenaming conventions have changed. Primarily, we've replaced non-static handles (such as database fields like \ncustomer.shortname\n or \nphysicalinterface.minitorindex\n or \nswitcher.name\n with immutable primary keys).\n\n\nAs such, you need to both rename the statistics structure and regenerate the configuration. \nIt is strongly recommended you copy your existing files and do this in parallel or, at least keep a backup.\n Also, stop the MRTG daemon before starting.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nFirst, you'll need to update your local configuration in \n.env\n by setting something like:\n\n\nGRAPHER_BACKENDS=\nmrtg\n\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_LOGDIR=\n/path/to/mrtg/data\n\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_WORKDIR=\n/path/to/mrtg/data\n\nGRAPHER_CACHE_ENABLED=true\n\n\n\n\nSee the \nGrapher\n documentation for full details.\n\n\nYou'll then need to migrate all your MRTG files to the new naming scheme:\n\n\n# set a variable for what will become the 'old' files for convenience\nOLDMRTG=/home/old\n\n# v3 MRTG directory is /home/mrtg. let's move it out of the way\nmv /home/mrtg $OLDMRTG\n\n# position ourselves in the IXP Manager root directory\ncd /path/to/ixp4\n\n# stop mrtg\nservice mrtg stop  # or as appropriate for your platform\n\n# migrate IXP graphs\nphp artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L $OLDMRTG -X | sh\n\n# migrate infrastructure graphs\nphp artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L $OLDMRTG -I | sh\n\n# migrate switch graphs\nphp artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L $OLDMRTG -S | sh\n\n# migrate trunk graphs and configuration\nphp artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L $OLDMRTG -T | sh\nphp artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade migrate-trunk-config --no-backup\n\n# create member directories\nphp artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mkdir -L $OLDMRTG -M | sh\n\n# migrate member physical interface graphs\nphp artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L $OLDMRTG -P | sh\n\n# migrate member LAG graphs\nphp artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L $OLDMRTG -Q | sh\n\n# migrate member aggregate graphs\nphp artisan grapher:backend:mrtg:upgrade mv -L $OLDMRTG -C | sh\n\n# regenerate mrtg configuration\nphp artisan grapher:generate-configuration -B mrtg \n path/to/mrtg.conf\n\n# start mrtg\nservice mrtg start  # or as appropriate for your platform",

You can get this, for example, by hovering over the edit action in the VLAN listing in IXP Manager and finding the number in the URL.\n\n\nprotocol\n is either \n4\n (IPv4) or \n6\n (IPv6). Any other value will lead to a runtime exception.\n\n\nwe have currently defined three types which are used for grouping routers in the UI and for other selection purposes:\n\n\nRC\n - route collector;\n\n\nRS\n - route server;\n\n\nAS112\n - an AS112 BGP peer (see \nINEX's AS112 documentation\n as an example).\n\n\nname\n - name / description of the router's purpose.\n\n\nshortname\n - used in dropdowns or other space constrained areas where \nname\n may be too long.\n\n\nrouter_id\n - the router's BGP ID (e.g. \n192.0.2.8\n).\n\n\npeering_ip\n - the IPv4/6 address that this router initiates BGP peering sessions from.\n\n\nasn\n - the router's AS number.\n\n\nsoftware\n - there is no specific use for this as yet.\n\n\nmgmt_ip\n - the IP to address this server / router at for management functions such as Nagios monitoring.\n\n\napi\n and \napi_type\n - the API end point for this server/router. The only use case for this so far is for the built-in \nlooking glass\n functionality via \nBirdseye\n.\n\n\nlg_access\n - who should be allow access the looking glass. One of:\n\n\nAUTH_PUBLIC\n - publicly available to all;\n\n\nAUTH_CUSTUSER\n - must be logged into IXP Manager as any user;\n\n\nAUTH_SUPERUSER\n - must be logged into IXP Manager as an administrator (no customer access).\n\n\nquarantine\n - a flag to indicate if this router is part of the IXP's quarantine / test infrastructure. For example, INEX runs two parallel route collectors: one quarantine and one production. When customers have issues or are being provisioned, they are placed in the quarantine LAN and we can examine BGP announcements safely on the non-production quarantine devices. When a router is marked as quarantine, it is only visible in looking glass dropdowns to customers who also have a port in quarantine (physical interface status).\n\n\nbgp_lc\n - a flag to indicate if the router supports \nRFC8092\n / \nlarge BGP communities\n.\n\n\ntemplate\n - the template to use to generate the configuration. See stock examples \nhere\n (and note that \nskinning\n is supported).\n\n\n\n\nTypically your \nrouters.php\n file would hold multiple such entries. It is our intention to move this into the UI and database.\n\n\nGeneration Overview\n\n\nThe simplest configuration to generate is the route collector configuration. A route collector is an IXP router which serves only to \naccept all routes and export no routes\n. It is used for problem diagnosis, to aid customer monitoring and for looking glasses (see \nINEX's here\n.\n\n\nThe \nstandard configuration\n simply pulls in a fairly standard header (sets up router ID, listening address and - for the collector at least - some unused filters) and creates a session for all customer routers on the given VLAN (see \nvlan_id\n above).\n\n\nIn the above example, the route handle is the array's associative key (\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n) and - for the given router handle - the configuration can be generated via:\n\n\n# The key is generated in IXP Manager via the top right menu: *My Account -\n API Keys*\nKEY=\nyour-admin-ixp-manager-api-key\n\n# The base URL of your IXP Manager install plus: 'api/v4/router/gen_config'\nURL=\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/gen_config\n\n# The handle is the PHP associative key from `config/routers.php` as described above\nHANDLE=\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n\n# Then the complete URL is formed as:\ncurl --fail -s -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: ${KEY}\n ${URL}/${HANDLE} \n${HANDLE}.conf\n\n\n\n\nConfigurations for the route server and AS112 templates can be configured just as easily. The stock templates for both are secure and well tested and can be used by setting the \ntemplate\n element of the router configuration above to the following:\n\n\n\n\nAS112: \n'api/v4/router/as112/bird/standard'\n\n\nRoute Server: \n'api/v4/router/server/bird/standard'\n\n\n\n\nWe also provide sample scripts for automating the re-configuration of these services by cron. See the \n-v4\n scripts \nin this directory\n. These are quite robust and have been in production for ~3 years at INEX (as of Jan 2017).\n\n\nRoute Servers\n\n\nNormally on a peering exchange, all connected parties will establish bilateral peering relationships with each other customer connected to the exchange. As the number of connected parties increases, it becomes increasingly more difficult to manage peering relationships with customers of the exchange.\n\n\nHowever, by using a route servers for peering relationships, the number of BGP sessions per router stays at two: one for each route server (assuming a resilient set up). Clearly this is a more sustainable way of maintaining IXP peering relationships with a large number of participants.\n\n\nYou will have learnt above how to automatically generate route server configurations. This section goes into a bit more specific detail on INEX's route server configuration (shipped with IXP Manager) and why it's safe to use.\n\n\nThe features of the route server configurations that we generate include:\n\n\n\n\nfull prefix filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required);\n\n\nfull origin ASN filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required);\n\n\nin all cases, prefix filtering for IPv4 and v6 based on the IANA special purpose registries (also known as bogon lists);\n\n\nensuring next hop is the neighbor address to ensure no next hop hijacking;\n\n\nmax prefix limits;\n\n\nmultiple VLAN interfaces for a single member supported;\n\n\nlarge BGP communities supported;\n\n\na decade of production use and experience.\n\n\n\n\nThere are \nsome old notes on route server testing here\n which may also be useful.\n\n\nIRRDB Prefixes and ASN Filtering\n\n\nIXP Manager can maintain a list of member route:/route6: prefixes and origin ASNs as registered in IRRDBs in its database and then use these to, for example, generate strict inbound filters on route servers.\n\n\nPrerequisite:\n you need to have set up some IRRDB sources (e.g. RIPE's whois service) under the \nIXP Admin Actions / IRRDB Configuration\n on the left hand side menu. There is a database seeder to install some to start you off via the following (but thius is typically done during installation):\n\n\n./artisan db:seed --class=IRRDBs\n\n\n\n\nBGPQ3 is a very easy and fast way of querying IRRDBs. You first need to install this on your system. Then configure the path to it in \nconfig/ixp_tools.php\n. If you have not used this file before, you'll need to create your own local copy as follows:\n\n\ncp config/config/ixp_tools.php.dist config/config/ixp_tools.php\n\n\n\n\nThen set the full call path for \nbgpq3\n in this file:\n\n\n?php\n\n  'irrdb' =\n [\n        'bgpq' =\n [\n            'path' =\n '/path/to/bgpq3',\n        ],\n    ],\n\n\n\n\nTo populate (and update) your local IRRDB, run the following commands (changing the path as appropriate):\n\n\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-prefix-db\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-asn-db\n\n\n\n\nThese should be added to cron to run ~once per day (using the --quiet flag).\n\n\nThere are four levels of verbosity:\n\n\n\n\n-quiet\n: no output unless there's an error / issue.\n\n\nno option: simple stats on each customer's update results.\n\n\n-vv\n: include per customer and overall timings (database, processing and network).\n\n\n-vvv\n (debug): show prefixes/ASNs added remove also.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also specify a specific customer to update (rather than all) with an additional free form parameter. The database is searched for a matching customer in the order: customer ASN; customer ID (database primary key); and customer shortname. E.g.:\n\n\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-prefix-db 64511\n\n\n\n\nThe IRRDB update commands will:\n\n\n\n\niterate over all route server client customers for IPv4 and IPv6 (unless a specific customer is specified);\n\n\nuse the appropriate AS macro or ASN;\n\n\nquery the RADB against the appropriate source set for that customer;\n\n\ncompare prefixes(/ASNs) in the database already (if any) against RADB and insert / delete as appropriate;\n\n\nvalidate the prefix for proper CIDR notation before database inserts;\n\n\nupdate the last_seen time for all prefixes(/ASNs) for that customer;\n\n\n\n\nWe use transactions to update the database so, even in the middle of a refresh, a full set of prefixes for all customers will still be available.\n\n\nNote that our current implementation only queries RADB as BGPQ3 does not support the RIPE whois protocol.\n Our version will however set the RADB source database according to the member's stated IRRDB database as set on the customer add / edit page - so, for customer's registered with the RIPE IRRDB, the RIPE database of RADB is queried.",

            "text": "Normally on a peering exchange, all connected parties will establish bilateral peering relationships with each other customer connected to the exchange. As the number of connected parties increases, it becomes increasingly more difficult to manage peering relationships with customers of the exchange.  However, by using a route servers for peering relationships, the number of BGP sessions per router stays at two: one for each route server (assuming a resilient set up). Clearly this is a more sustainable way of maintaining IXP peering relationships with a large number of participants.  You will have learnt above how to automatically generate route server configurations. This section goes into a bit more specific detail on INEX's route server configuration (shipped with IXP Manager) and why it's safe to use.  The features of the route server configurations that we generate include:   full prefix filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required);  full origin ASN filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required);  in all cases, prefix filtering for IPv4 and v6 based on the IANA special purpose registries (also known as bogon lists);  ensuring next hop is the neighbor address to ensure no next hop hijacking;  max prefix limits;  multiple VLAN interfaces for a single member supported;  large BGP communities supported;  a decade of production use and experience.   There are  some old notes on route server testing here  which may also be useful.",

            "text": "IXP Manager can maintain a list of member route:/route6: prefixes and origin ASNs as registered in IRRDBs in its database and then use these to, for example, generate strict inbound filters on route servers.  Prerequisite:  you need to have set up some IRRDB sources (e.g. RIPE's whois service) under the  IXP Admin Actions / IRRDB Configuration  on the left hand side menu. There is a database seeder to install some to start you off via the following (but thius is typically done during installation):  ./artisan db:seed --class=IRRDBs  BGPQ3 is a very easy and fast way of querying IRRDBs. You first need to install this on your system. Then configure the path to it in  config/ixp_tools.php . If you have not used this file before, you'll need to create your own local copy as follows:  cp config/config/ixp_tools.php.dist config/config/ixp_tools.php  Then set the full call path for  bgpq3  in this file:  ?php\n\n  'irrdb' =  [\n        'bgpq' =  [\n            'path' =  '/path/to/bgpq3',\n        ],\n    ],  To populate (and update) your local IRRDB, run the following commands (changing the path as appropriate):  /srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-prefix-db\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-asn-db  These should be added to cron to run ~once per day (using the --quiet flag).  There are four levels of verbosity:   -quiet : no output unless there's an error / issue.  no option: simple stats on each customer's update results.  -vv : include per customer and overall timings (database, processing and network).  -vvv  (debug): show prefixes/ASNs added remove also.   You can also specify a specific customer to update (rather than all) with an additional free form parameter. The database is searched for a matching customer in the order: customer ASN; customer ID (database primary key); and customer shortname. E.g.:  /srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-prefix-db 64511  The IRRDB update commands will:   iterate over all route server client customers for IPv4 and IPv6 (unless a specific customer is specified);  use the appropriate AS macro or ASN;  query the RADB against the appropriate source set for that customer;  compare prefixes(/ASNs) in the database already (if any) against RADB and insert / delete as appropriate;  validate the prefix for proper CIDR notation before database inserts;  update the last_seen time for all prefixes(/ASNs) for that customer;   We use transactions to update the database so, even in the middle of a refresh, a full set of prefixes for all customers will still be available.  Note that our current implementation only queries RADB as BGPQ3 does not support the RIPE whois protocol.  Our version will however set the RADB source database according to the member's stated IRRDB database as set on the customer add / edit page - so, for customer's registered with the RIPE IRRDB, the RIPE database of RADB is queried.",

            "text": "Patch Panels / Cross Connects\n\n\nOne of the more difficult things for an IXP to manage is the sheer volume of patch panels / cross connects they need to manage. We have approached the issue a number of times in IXP Manger but abandoned the attempt every time. Typically our original solutions were over-engineered where all we really needed was something which could replace a spreadsheet per panel.\n\n\nWe believe we have now developed a feature complete and useful means of managing patch panels and associated cross connects.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nAdd / edit patch panels  (which includes cable and connector types).\n\n\nList associated patch panel ports which includes:\n\n\ntheir state (such as available / prewired, awaiting cross connect, connected, awaiting cease, reserved, broken).\n\n\nassociated customer and/or switchport.\n\n\nco-location provider's circuit reference.\n\n\ninternal ticket references.\n\n\nTransition ports from available / prewired to awaiting x-connect to connected to awaiting cease to ceased and then available again.\n\n\nCustomer view of their cross connects.\n\n\nPublic (visible to customers) and private notes per cross connect.\n\n\nAttach public and private files to cross connects (such as test results, completion documents, order forms, etc).\n\n\nMaintain complete history of a patch panel port.\n\n\nGenerate and email LoAs (as PDF) with a URL verification function for co-location providers.\n\n\nGenerate emails for connection and cease requests as well as an email providing full customer view of a cross connect.\n\n\nTypically fibre ports are \nduplex\n ports but there is a growing use of BiDi optics meaning simplex ports. Our implementation treats all ports as simplex but you can mark it as duplex and set its partner port.\n\n\n\n\nDuplex Fibre Ports\n\n\nWe suggest adding fibre ports as two ports per duplex port. I.e. if your patch panel has 12 duplex ports, enter this as 24 ports. When allocating ports later, you can set it as a duplex port and select its \npartner / slave port\n. This will future proof your patch panels for the growing use of bidi optics and other simplex based xWDM fibre solutions.\n\n\nFrom our experience, duplex fibre ports are often identified as their individual strands. For example, \nduplex port 5\n would be referenced as \nF9/F10\n.\n\n\nYour mileage may vary on this but we need to allow this flexibility to cover both use-cases. You always have options however:\n\n\n\n\nyou can change the presentation of how these ports are referenced externally by \nskinning\n the templates.\n\n\nyou have the option to edit emails before they are sent to also present this as you wish.\n\n\nyou can chose to treat duplex ports as single ports rather than doubling them up.\n\n\nwhen you have duplex ports on a patch panel, IXP Manager will provide a duplex view by default with a CSS-based toggle to reveal the typical partner ports.\n\n\nif you think IXP Manager can make this easier, please talk to us. \nBut we cannot cover every use case programatically. We've opted to allow flexibility rather than dictate a particular format.\n\n\n\n\nAdding a Patch Panel\n\n\nThe following image shows a typical \nadd a new patch panel\n form (as of v4.3). You'll note that clicking \nHelp\n provides detailed context aware help messages.\n\n\n\n\nMost of this is self-explanatory but:\n\n\n\n\nBy default, we set the \nColocation Reference\n to the \nPatch Panel Name\n. We are not sure it's a good idea for IXPs to create a second name different to the co-location provider's but this option is available to you. \nSeriously, think about what you are doing here - more references means more confusion!\n The cabinet and cable type is displayed in the list of patch panels so even with obscure data centre references, it should be easy to find what you need.\n\n\nLocation Notes\n: Data centre / co-location providers do a lot of weird, wonderful and strange things! They provide multiple references for a single patch panel (IXP cabinet, MMR, etc.), they get taken over and re-reference everything or even provide no discernable reference. The field is a freetext field that will be included (and parsed as Markdown) in all emails generated by IXP Manager to help you help them identify a patch panel!\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to that, we will also use a cabinets \nU's are counted from top/bottom\n, and a patch panel's \nU position\n and \nmounted at front/rear\n to also create a location description.\n\n When setting the \nNumber of Ports\n, ensure you count duplex fibre ports as \ntwo ports\n. So 12 duplex fibre ports would be entered as 24. When editing a patch panel, this input field represents the number of additional ports you want to add to a patch panel and thus defaults to 0 in that situation.\n\n \nPort Name Prefix\n: This is an optional field intended for use on fibre patch panels. As an example, you may wish to prefix individual fibre strands in a duplex port with F which would mean the name of a duplex port would be displayed as F1/F2.\n* \nChargeable\n: Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. Setting this only sets the default option when allocating ports to members later. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other.\n\n\nFiltering Patch Panel Ports\n\n\nQuite often, all you are looking for is a free in a particular location (data centre) or cabinet of a particular cable type (UTP / SMF / etc.).\n\n\nIXP Manager makes this easy from the \nPatch Panels\n page via the top right button labeled \nFilter Options\n. When clicked, this yields an advanced search as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCabinets auto-fills when you chose (or change) a location.\n\n\nPatch Panel Port States\n\n\nA patch panel port can have the following states:\n\n\n\n\nAvailable\n: The port is free and available for use.\n\n\nPrewired\n: This is equivalent to available but it means the port is prewired to a given switchport (you set the port when setting the prewired status). This is useful for IXPs that prewire a bunch of ports to avoid remote hands costs / data centre visits.\n\n\nAwaiting Xconnect\n: Port has been assigned to a member and we are awaiting the co-location provider to install the cross connect. In this state, context aware actions such as emailing connection requests, LoA generation and \nSet Connected\n are all available.\n\n\nConnected\n: Connected and in use.\n\n\nAwaiting Cease\n: This connection is no longer required and we are awaiting the end user / co-location provider to cease the connection.\n\n\nCeased\n: You will never see a ceased state. When a cross connect is marked as ceased, it's current state is archived (for history, include files) and the port is reset to \nAvailable\n. We do not revert to \nPrewired\n but an information message is shown to the user to hint this.\n\n\nReserved\n: Useful to mark particular ports as \noff limits\n for whatever reason.\n\n\nBroken\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\nFree / Available Ports\n\n\nIXP Manager will colour ports in the \nAvailable\n, \nPrewired\n and \nAwaiting Cease\n states are green allowing an easy visual indication of available ports.\n\n\nPatch Panel Port Lifecycle\n\n\nPatch panel ports start as either \navailable\n or \nprewired\n. The context menu in these states is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnset Prewired\n is available as this port has a \nPrewired\n status. Clicking this reverts it to plain \nAvailable\n and disassociates it from the prewired port.\n\n\nEdit Note...\n is always available and provides a pop up to edit public and private notes associated with the port (current lifecycle - ceased ports have their notes at that time archived and cleared).\n\n\n\n\nThe main lifecycle option here is \nAllocate\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n: A one line short description to be shown in the list of patch panel ports. Just enough to help explain the ports purpose. Detailed information should be placed in the notes section. Can also be used to explain a reserved / broken / other port. Note that this is parsed as Markdown.\n\n\n\n\nNB:\n A description is discouraged for customer ports connected to a switch. The customer name and switch port are the description.\n\n \nColocation Circuit Reference\n: this is the reference provided by the colocation provider to uniquely reference this cross connect.\n\n \nTicket Reference(s)\n: This is a free text field to be used by IXPs as they wish. The intended use is to enter helpdesk ticket references that relate to this cross connect order.\n\n \nDuplex connection?\n: Clicking this allows you to select the slave port for duplex connections.\n\n \nSwitch / Switch Port\n / \nCustomer\n: You have a number of options when allocating a port:\n  * If the port is pre-wired then the switch / switch port will be set here.\n  * If you chose a switch port which has been allocated to a customer, then this patch panel port will also be allocated to that customer. The backend logic will detect if this is the case and update the customer field.\n  * Conversely, if you chose a customer first, the switch / switch port dropdowns will be populated with only that customer's assigned ports.\n  * Sometimes you will get cross connects that are not intended to be connected to peering switches (e.g. connections to co-located customer equipment, IXP metro connections, etc.). In these cases, just select the customer (and if it's the IXP itself, select the IXP customer) and leave switch / switch port unselected.\n  * If you need to reset these fields, just click either of the Reset button.\n\n \nPatch Panel Port Status\n: when allocating a port, this will allow you to set the state to \nAwaiting Xconnect\n or \nConnected\n.\n\n \nPhysical Interface Status\n: this is not depicted above. If the selected switch port has already been assigned to a customer by way of a physical interface, you will have the option to update this here also.\n\n \nPublic\n and \nPrivate Notes\n: Public notes are available to the customer. Both fields are interpreted as Markdown.\n\n \nChargeable\n: Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other. How individual IXPs use this is up to them.\n\n \nInternal Use\n: Marks the port as used by the IXP itself. E.g. metro connections.\n\n \nOwned By\n: Useful indication for billing and cease requests. Should represent the contractural owner of the cross connect. One of: Customer, IXP, Service Provider, Data Centre, Other. \nService Provider\n might be a metro provider where they ordered the cross connect.\n\n\nOnce a port is allocated, it enters the \nAwaiting XConnect\n / \nConnected\n state and there are additional context menu options available:\n\n\n\n\nThe three lifecycle actions are:\n\n\n\n\nSet Connected\n: updates the status (and allows you to add public/private notes). You next action after this should be \nEmail - Connect\n.\n\n\nSet Awaiting Cease\n: mark the port and pending disconnection. Your next action after this should be \nEmail - Cease\n.\n\n\nSet Ceased\n: this is a \ntransitive state\n in that it doesn't \nstick\n. When you mark a patch panel as ceased, the existing details (including files and notes) are archived as part of the port's history and then port is then cleared and made available again.\n\n\n\n\nFile Attachments\n\n\nOver the lifetime of a cross connect - and particularly when it is being ordered, there may be files exchanges between you and your customers or the colocation provider. These can be added to the patch panel port via the \nAttach File...\n option.\n\n\nThe dialog will dynamically determine the maximum file upload size based on your PHP settings. To alter this, change the following in your server's appropriate \nphp.ini\n:\n\n\n; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.\nupload_max_filesize = 40M\n\n; Must be greater than or equal to upload_max_filesize\npost_max_size = 40M\n\n\n\n\nPlease search the internet for further help as this is outside the scope of IXP Manager documentation.\n\n\nThe following features apply to file attachments:\n\n\n\n\nthey are archived along with the port history when a cross connect is ceased.\n\n\nthey are stored under \n$IXPROOT/storage/files/ppp\n.\n\n\ntwo files of the same name cannot be uploaded for a single patch panel port.\n\n\nthey can be marked as public or private:\n\n\npublic files are accessible to the customer through their own dashboard.\n\n\npublic files are attached to the \nEmail - Information\n email.\n\n\n\n\nLoA Generation\n\n\nMany co-location providers will not accept a cross connect order without a LoA \n(Letter of Agency/Authority)\n from the party to whom the cross connect is to be delivered (typically the IXP).\n\n\nIXP Manager will generate a PDF LoA to download or include in the emails it generates for you. Here is an example:\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to \nskin\n this yourself to change the legalese, address and contact details and potentially add a logo. See the version INEX uses \nhere\n (which includes and embedded PNG logo).\n\n\nNote that \nDompdf\n is used to turn the HTML template into a PDF and it has some restrictions.\n\n\nYou have two options for generating LoAs (without having IXP Manager email them):\n\n\n\n\nDownload PDF\n: downloads the PDF via your browser.\n\n\nView PDF\n: displays the PDF LoA in your browser (where browser supports it).\n\n\n\n\nLoA Verification\n\n\nThe stock LoA template (and INEX's version) includes a link that allows co-location browsers to click on to verify its veracity.\n\n\nOn successful verification, the end user sees:\n\n\n\n\nEmail Generation\n\n\nIXP Manager allows you to send four emails related to patch panels / cross connects (port status dependent). These are listed below. The Email editor looks as follows:\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\n\n\n\nthe option to attach a PDF LoA is a checkbox.\n\n\nthe email is written in Markdown with a preview available. The email is sent as both HTML (from the Markdown) and the plaintext version.\n\n\n\n\nThe four email templates available are:\n\n\n\n\nEmail - Connect\n: Email the customer a request to order a cross connect to the given demarcation points. A LoA is attached as a PDF by default unless you uncheck the box in the email editor.\n\n\nEmail - Cease\n: Email the customer a request to cease a cross connect.\n\n\nEmail - Information\n: Email the customer all details on file about a cross connect. We often get requests for this at INEX and this simplifies the process. The generated email includes:\n\n\nthe standard details regarding port and co-location reference;\n\n\npublic notes;\n\n\npublic files as attachments.\n\n\nEmail - LoA\n: Email a LoA to the customer as attached as a PDF. This is similar to \nEmail - Connect\n but it is more reflective of a typical response to a second request for a LoA.\n\n\n\n\nAll email templates can be \nskinned\n for your own needs. See INEX's example skins \nhere\n.\n\n\nViewing Patch Panel Details and Archives\n\n\nEach patch panel port row has the following button:\n\n\n\n\nThe number in the badge indicates how many historical records are available.\n\n\nClicking on the button yields the following view screen:\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment History\n\n\nThe Patch Panels functionality was developed during Q1 2017 and added in March 2017.

Most of this is self-explanatory but:   By default, we set the  Colocation Reference  to the  Patch Panel Name . We are not sure it's a good idea for IXPs to create a second name different to the co-location provider's but this option is available to you.  Seriously, think about what you are doing here - more references means more confusion!  The cabinet and cable type is displayed in the list of patch panels so even with obscure data centre references, it should be easy to find what you need.  Location Notes : Data centre / co-location providers do a lot of weird, wonderful and strange things! They provide multiple references for a single patch panel (IXP cabinet, MMR, etc.), they get taken over and re-reference everything or even provide no discernable reference. The field is a freetext field that will be included (and parsed as Markdown) in all emails generated by IXP Manager to help you help them identify a patch panel!   In addition to that, we will also use a cabinets  U's are counted from top/bottom , and a patch panel's  U position  and  mounted at front/rear  to also create a location description.  When setting the  Number of Ports , ensure you count duplex fibre ports as  two ports . So 12 duplex fibre ports would be entered as 24. When editing a patch panel, this input field represents the number of additional ports you want to add to a patch panel and thus defaults to 0 in that situation.   Port Name Prefix : This is an optional field intended for use on fibre patch panels. As an example, you may wish to prefix individual fibre strands in a duplex port with F which would mean the name of a duplex port would be displayed as F1/F2.\n*  Chargeable : Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection.

Edit Note...  is always available and provides a pop up to edit public and private notes associated with the port (current lifecycle - ceased ports have their notes at that time archived and cleared).   The main lifecycle option here is  Allocate :    Description : A one line short description to be shown in the list of patch panel ports. Just enough to help explain the ports purpose. Detailed information should be placed in the notes section. Can also be used to explain a reserved / broken / other port. Note that this is parsed as Markdown.   NB:  A description is discouraged for customer ports connected to a switch. The customer name and switch port are the description.   Colocation Circuit Reference : this is the reference provided by the colocation provider to uniquely reference this cross connect.   Ticket Reference(s) : This is a free text field to be used by IXPs as they wish. The intended use is to enter helpdesk ticket references that relate to this cross connect order.   Duplex connection? : Clicking this allows you to select the slave port for duplex connections.   Switch / Switch Port  /  Customer : You have a number of options when allocating a port:\n  * If the port is pre-wired then the switch / switch port will be set here.\n  * If you chose a switch port which has been allocated to a customer, then this patch panel port will also be allocated to that customer. The backend logic will detect if this is the case and update the customer field.\n  * Conversely, if you chose a customer first, the switch / switch port dropdowns will be populated with only that customer's assigned ports.\n  * Sometimes you will get cross connects that are not intended to be connected to peering switches (e.g. connections to co-located customer equipment, IXP metro connections, etc.). In these cases, just select the customer (and if it's the IXP itself, select the IXP customer) and leave switch / switch port unselected.\n  * If you need to reset these fields, just click either of the Reset button.   Patch Panel Port Status : when allocating a port, this will allow you to set the state to  Awaiting Xconnect  or  Connected .   Physical Interface Status : this is not depicted above. If the selected switch port has already been assigned to a customer by way of a physical interface, you will have the option to update this here also.   Public  and  Private Notes : Public notes are available to the customer. Both fields are interpreted as Markdown.   Chargeable : Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other. How individual IXPs use this is up to them.   Internal Use : Marks the port as used by the IXP itself. E.g. metro connections.   Owned By : Useful indication for billing and cease requests. Should represent the contractural owner of the cross connect. One of: Customer, IXP, Service Provider, Data Centre, Other.  Service Provider  might be a metro provider where they ordered the cross connect.  Once a port is allocated, it enters the  Awaiting XConnect  /  Connected  state and there are additional context menu options available:   The three lifecycle actions are:   Set Connected : updates the status (and allows you to add public/private notes).

For example:\n\n\nmkdir -p /srv/mrtg\n\n\n\n\nIn your `.env, you need to set the following options:\n\n\n# the database type to use - either log or rrd\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_DBTYPE=\nrrd\n\n# where to store log/rrd/png files as created above. This is from the perspective\n# of the mrtg daemon so should also be local\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_WORKDIR=\n/tmp\n\n# where to find the WORKDIR above from IXP Manager's perspective. This can be a\n# local directory or a URL to remote web server\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_LOGDIR=\nhttp://collector.example.com/mrtg\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now generate a MRTG configuration by executing a command such as:\n\n\n# output to stdout:\n./artisan grapher:generate-configuration -B mrtg\n# output to a named file\n./artisan grapher:generate-configuration -B mrtg -O /tmp/mrtg.cfg.candidate\n\n\n\n\nYou could also combine a syntax check before putting the resultant file live. Here's a complete example that could be run via cron:\n\n\n#! /bin/sh\n\nAPPLICATION_PATH=/srv/ixp\n\n# Synchronise configuration files\n${APPLICATION_PATH}/artisan grapher:generate-configuration -B mrtg -O /tmp/mrtg.cfg.candidate\n\n/usr/bin/mrtg --check /tmp/mrtg.cfg.candidate                 \\\n    \n /bin/mv /tmp/mrtg.cfg.candidate /etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg\n\n\n\n\nIf your MRTG collector is on a different server, you could use a script such as the following to safely update MRTG:\n\n\n#! /bin/bash\n\ncurl --fail -s -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: your_api_key\n \\\n    https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/grapher/mrtg-config \n/etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg.$$\n\nif [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then\n    echo \nWARNING: COULD NOT FETCH UP TO DATE MRTG CONFIGURATION!\n\n    exit -1\nfi\n\ncd /etc/mrtg\n\ncat mrtg.cfg    | egrep -v '^#.*$' | egrep -v '^[ ]+Based on configuration last generated by.*$' \nmrtg.cfg.filtered\ncat mrtg.cfg.$$ | egrep -v '^#.*$' | egrep -v '^[ ]+Based on configuration last generated by.*$' \nmrtg.cfg.$$.filtered\ndiff mrtg.cfg.filtered mrtg.cfg.$$.filtered \n/dev/null\nDIFF=$?\n\nrm mrtg.cfg.filtered\nrm mrtg.cfg.$$.filtered\n\nif [[ $DIFF -eq 0 ]]; then\n    rm mrtg.cfg.$$\n    exit 0\nfi\n\n/usr/local/bin/mrtg --check /etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg.$$                 \\\n    \n /bin/mv /etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg.$$ /etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg \\\n    \n /etc/rc.d/mrtg_daemon restart \n /dev/null 2\n1\n\n\n\n\nNote that our header template starts MRTG as a daemon. On FreeBSD, MRTG comes with an initd script by default and you can kick it off on boot with something like the following in rc.conf:\n\n\nmrtg_daemon_enable=\nYES\n\nmrtg_daemon_config=\n/etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, on Ubuntu it does not but it comes with a /etc/cron.d/mrtg file which kicks it off every five minutes (it will daemonise the first time and further cron jobs will have no effect). If you use this method, you will need to have your periodic update script restart / stop the daemon when the configuration changes (as demonstrated in the above script).\n\n\nTo start and stop it via standard initd scripts on Ubuntu, use \nan initd script such as this\n  (\nsource\n:\n\n\ncp $APPLICATION_PATH/tools/runtime/mrtg/ubuntu-mrtg-initd /etc/init.d/mrtg\nchmod +x /etc/init.d/mrtg\nupdate-rc.d mrtg defaults\n/etc/init.d/mrtg start\n\n\n\n\nRemember to disable the default cron job for MRTG on Ubuntu!\n\n\nCustomising the Configuration\n\n\nAn example of how to customise the MRTG configuration \ncan be found in the skinning documenation\n.\n\n\nInserting Traffic Data Into the Database / Reporting Emails\n\n\nThe MRTG backend inserts daily summaries into MySQL for reporting. An example crontab for this is:\n\n\n\n0 2   * * *   www-data        /srv/ixpmanager/artisan grapher:upload-stats-to-db\n\n0 4   * * *   www-data        /srv/ixpmanager/artisan grapher:email-traffic-deltas --stddev=1.5 -v user1@example.com,user2@example.com\n\n30 10 * * tue www-data        /srv/ixpmanager/artisan grapher:email-port-utilisations --threshold=80 ops@inex.ie,barry.rhodes@inex.ie,eileen@inex.ie\n\n31 10 * * *   www-data        /srv/ixpmanager/artisan grapher:email-ports-with-counts --discards ops@inex.ie\n\n32 10 * * *   www-data        /srv/ixpmanager/artisan grapher:email-ports-with-counts --errors ops@inex.ie\n\n\n\n\nwhich, in the order above, do:\n\n\n\n\nOnce per day, upload \nyesterday's\n summary of MRTG statistics into the database.\n\n\nEmail a report of members whose average traffic has changed by more than 1.5 times their standard deviation to \nuser1@example.com\n and \nuser2@example.com\n.\n\n\nEmail a report of all ports with \n=80% utilisation yesterday.\n\n\nEmail a report of all ports with a non-zero discard count yesterday.\n\n\nEmail a report of all ports with a non-zero error count yesterday.",

This can be a\n# local directory or a URL to remote web server\nGRAPHER_BACKEND_MRTG_LOGDIR= http://collector.example.com/mrtg   You can now generate a MRTG configuration by executing a command such as:  # output to stdout:\n./artisan grapher:generate-configuration -B mrtg\n# output to a named file\n./artisan grapher:generate-configuration -B mrtg -O /tmp/mrtg.cfg.candidate  You could also combine a syntax check before putting the resultant file live. Here's a complete example that could be run via cron:  #! /bin/sh\n\nAPPLICATION_PATH=/srv/ixp\n\n# Synchronise configuration files\n${APPLICATION_PATH}/artisan grapher:generate-configuration -B mrtg -O /tmp/mrtg.cfg.candidate\n\n/usr/bin/mrtg --check /tmp/mrtg.cfg.candidate                 \\\n      /bin/mv /tmp/mrtg.cfg.candidate /etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg  If your MRTG collector is on a different server, you could use a script such as the following to safely update MRTG:  #! /bin/bash\n\ncurl --fail -s -H  X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: your_api_key  \\\n    https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/grapher/mrtg-config  /etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg.$$\n\nif [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then\n    echo  WARNING: COULD NOT FETCH UP TO DATE MRTG CONFIGURATION! \n    exit -1\nfi\n\ncd /etc/mrtg\n\ncat mrtg.cfg    | egrep -v '^#.*$' | egrep -v '^[ ]+Based on configuration last generated by.*$'  mrtg.cfg.filtered\ncat mrtg.cfg.$$ | egrep -v '^#.*$' | egrep -v '^[ ]+Based on configuration last generated by.*$'  mrtg.cfg.$$.filtered\ndiff mrtg.cfg.filtered mrtg.cfg.$$.filtered  /dev/null\nDIFF=$?\n\nrm mrtg.cfg.filtered\nrm mrtg.cfg.$$.filtered\n\nif [[ $DIFF -eq 0 ]]; then\n    rm mrtg.cfg.$$\n    exit 0\nfi\n\n/usr/local/bin/mrtg --check /etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg.$$                 \\\n      /bin/mv /etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg.$$ /etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg \\\n      /etc/rc.d/mrtg_daemon restart   /dev/null 2 1  Note that our header template starts MRTG as a daemon. On FreeBSD, MRTG comes with an initd script by default and you can kick it off on boot with something like the following in rc.conf:  mrtg_daemon_enable= YES \nmrtg_daemon_config= /etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg   However, on Ubuntu it does not but it comes with a /etc/cron.d/mrtg file which kicks it off every five minutes (it will daemonise the first time and further cron jobs will have no effect). If you use this method, you will need to have your periodic update script restart / stop the daemon when the configuration changes (as demonstrated in the above script).  To start and stop it via standard initd scripts on Ubuntu, use  an initd script such as this   ( source :  cp $APPLICATION_PATH/tools/runtime/mrtg/ubuntu-mrtg-initd /etc/init.d/mrtg\nchmod +x /etc/init.d/mrtg\nupdate-rc.d mrtg defaults\n/etc/init.d/mrtg start  Remember to disable the default cron job for MRTG on Ubuntu!",

How this is done has been changed significantly from v3 to v4.\n\n\n\n\nNote that until officially deprecated, the older v3 methods still work and the \nofficial v3 documentation\n should be referenced for that.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Overview\n\n\nThe basic elements of \na router\n are configured in \nconfigs/routers.php\n. This is an optional file that is not included in version control so the best way to start it is to copy from the template:\n\n\ncp config/routers.php.dist config/routers.php\n\n\n\n\nA typical entry of a sample router (in standard PHP associative array syntax) is:\n\n\n?php\n    'rc1-lan1-ipv4' =\n [\n        'vlan_id'    =\n 1,\n        'protocol'   =\n 4,\n        'type'       =\n 'RC',   // RC|RS|AS112?\n        'name'       =\n 'INEX LAN1 - Route Collector - IPv4',\n        'shortname'  =\n 'RC1 - LAN1 - IPv4',\n        'router_id'  =\n '192.0.2.8',\n        'peering_ip' =\n '192.0.2.8',\n        'asn'        =\n 65500,\n        'software'   =\n 'bird',\n        'mgmt_ip'    =\n '203.0.113.8',\n        'api'        =\n 'http://rc1-lan1-ipv4.mgmt.example.com/api',\n        'api_type'   =\n 'birdseye',\n        'lg_access'  =\n Entities\\User::AUTH_PUBLIC,\n        'quarantine' =\n false,\n        'bgp_lc'     =\n false,\n        'template'   =\n 'api/v4/router/collector/bird/standard',\n    ],\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n is the \nhandle\n for this router to be used in API calls later (it's the key of the PHP associative array).\n\n\nvlan_id\n is not the VLAN 802.1q tag number but the \nvlan.id\n database column. You can get this, for example, by hovering over the edit action in the VLAN listing in IXP Manager and finding the number in the URL.\n\n\nprotocol\n is either \n4\n (IPv4) or \n6\n (IPv6). Any other value will lead to a runtime exception.\n\n\nwe have currently defined three types which are used for grouping routers in the UI and for other selection purposes:\n\n\nRC\n - route collector;\n\n\nRS\n - route server;\n\n\nAS112\n - an AS112 BGP peer (see \nINEX's AS112 documentation\n as an example).\n\n\nname\n - name / description of the router's purpose.\n\n\nshortname\n - used in dropdowns or other space constrained areas where \nname\n may be too long.\n\n\nrouter_id\n - the router's BGP ID (e.g. \n192.0.2.8\n).\n\n\npeering_ip\n - the IPv4/6 address that this router initiates BGP peering sessions from.\n\n\nasn\n - the router's AS number.\n\n\nsoftware\n - there is no specific use for this as yet.\n\n\nmgmt_ip\n - the IP to address this server / router at for management functions such as Nagios monitoring.\n\n\napi\n and \napi_type\n - the API end point for this server/router. The only use case for this so far is for the built-in \nlooking glass\n functionality via \nBirdseye\n.\n\n\nlg_access\n - who should be allow access the looking glass. One of:\n\n\nAUTH_PUBLIC\n - publicly available to all;\n\n\nAUTH_CUSTUSER\n - must be logged into IXP Manager as any user;\n\n\nAUTH_SUPERUSER\n - must be logged into IXP Manager as an administrator (no customer access).\n\n\nquarantine\n - a flag to indicate if this router is part of the IXP's quarantine / test infrastructure. For example, INEX runs two parallel route collectors: one quarantine and one production. When customers have issues or are being provisioned, they are placed in the quarantine LAN and we can examine BGP announcements safely on the non-production quarantine devices. When a router is marked as quarantine, it is only visible in looking glass dropdowns to customers who also have a port in quarantine (physical interface status).\n\n\nbgp_lc\n - a flag to indicate if the router supports \nRFC8092\n / \nlarge BGP communities\n.\n\n\ntemplate\n - the template to use to generate the configuration. See stock examples \nhere\n (and note that \nskinning\n is supported).\n\n\n\n\nTypically your \nrouters.php\n file would hold multiple such entries. It is our intention to move this into the UI and database.\n\n\nGeneration Overview\n\n\nThe simplest configuration to generate is the route collector configuration. A route collector is an IXP router which serves only to \naccept all routes and export no routes\n. It is used for problem diagnosis, to aid customer monitoring and for looking glasses (see \nINEX's here\n.\n\n\nThe \nstandard configuration\n simply pulls in a fairly standard header (sets up router ID, listening address and - for the collector at least - some unused filters) and creates a session for all customer routers on the given VLAN (see \nvlan_id\n above).\n\n\nIn the above example, the route handle is the array's associative key (\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n) and - for the given router handle - the configuration can be generated via:\n\n\n# The key is generated in IXP Manager via the top right menu: *My Account -\n API Keys*\nKEY=\nyour-admin-ixp-manager-api-key\n\n# The base URL of your IXP Manager install plus: 'api/v4/router/gen_config'\nURL=\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/gen_config\n\n# The handle is the PHP associative key from `config/routers.php` as described above\nHANDLE=\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n\n# Then the complete URL is formed as:\ncurl --fail -s -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: ${KEY}\n ${URL}/${HANDLE} \n${HANDLE}.conf\n\n\n\n\nConfigurations for the route server and AS112 templates can be configured just as easily. The stock templates for both are secure and well tested and can be used by setting the \ntemplate\n element of the router configuration above to the following:\n\n\n\n\nAS112: \n'api/v4/router/as112/bird/standard'\n\n\nRoute Server: \n'api/v4/router/server/bird/standard'\n\n\n\n\nWe also provide sample scripts for automating the re-configuration of these services by cron. See the \n-v4\n scripts \nin this directory\n. These are quite robust and have been in production for ~3 years at INEX (as of Jan 2017).\n\n\nRoute Servers\n\n\nNormally on a peering exchange, all connected parties will establish bilateral peering relationships with each other customer connected to the exchange. As the number of connected parties increases, it becomes increasingly more difficult to manage peering relationships with customers of the exchange.\n\n\nHowever, by using a route servers for peering relationships, the number of BGP sessions per router stays at two: one for each route server (assuming a resilient set up). Clearly this is a more sustainable way of maintaining IXP peering relationships with a large number of participants.\n\n\nYou will have learnt above how to automatically generate route server configurations. This section goes into a bit more specific detail on INEX's route server configuration (shipped with IXP Manager) and why it's safe to use.\n\n\nThe features of the route server configurations that we generate include:\n\n\n\n\nfull prefix filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required);\n\n\nfull origin ASN filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required);\n\n\nin all cases, prefix filtering for IPv4 and v6 based on the IANA special purpose registries (also known as bogon lists);\n\n\nensuring next hop is the neighbor address to ensure no next hop hijacking;\n\n\nmax prefix limits;\n\n\nmultiple VLAN interfaces for a single member supported;\n\n\nlarge BGP communities supported;\n\n\na decade of production use and experience.\n\n\n\n\nThere are \nsome old notes on route server testing here\n which may also be useful.\n\n\nIRRDB Prefixes and ASN Filtering\n\n\nIXP Manager can maintain a list of member route:/route6: prefixes and origin ASNs as registered in IRRDBs in its database and then use these to, for example, generate strict inbound filters on route servers.\n\n\nPrerequisite:\n you need to have set up some IRRDB sources (e.g. RIPE's whois service) under the \nIXP Admin Actions / IRRDB Configuration\n on the left hand side menu. There is a database seeder to install some to start you off via the following (but thius is typically done during installation):\n\n\n./artisan db:seed --class=IRRDBs\n\n\n\n\nBGPQ3 is a very easy and fast way of querying IRRDBs. You first need to install this on your system. Then configure the path to it in \nconfig/ixp_tools.php\n. If you have not used this file before, you'll need to create your own local copy as follows:\n\n\ncp config/config/ixp_tools.php.dist config/config/ixp_tools.php\n\n\n\n\nThen set the full call path for \nbgpq3\n in this file:\n\n\n?php\n\n  'irrdb' =\n [\n        'bgpq' =\n [\n            'path' =\n '/path/to/bgpq3',\n        ],\n    ],\n\n\n\n\nTo populate (and update) your local IRRDB, run the following commands (changing the path as appropriate):\n\n\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-prefix-db\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-asn-db\n\n\n\n\nThese should be added to cron to run ~once per day (using the --quiet flag).\n\n\nThere are four levels of verbosity:\n\n\n\n\n-quiet\n: no output unless there's an error / issue.\n\n\nno option: simple stats on each customer's update results.\n\n\n-vv\n: include per customer and overall timings (database, processing and network).\n\n\n-vvv\n (debug): show prefixes/ASNs added remove also.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also specify a specific customer to update (rather than all) with an additional free form parameter. The database is searched for a matching customer in the order: customer ASN; customer ID (database primary key); and customer shortname. E.g.:\n\n\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-prefix-db 64511\n\n\n\n\nThe IRRDB update commands will:\n\n\n\n\niterate over all route server client customers for IPv4 and IPv6 (unless a specific customer is specified);\n\n\nuse the appropriate AS macro or ASN;\n\n\nquery the RADB against the appropriate source set for that customer;\n\n\ncompare prefixes(/ASNs) in the database already (if any) against RADB and insert / delete as appropriate;\n\n\nvalidate the prefix for proper CIDR notation before database inserts;\n\n\nupdate the last_seen time for all prefixes(/ASNs) for that customer;\n\n\n\n\nWe use transactions to update the database so, even in the middle of a refresh, a full set of prefixes for all customers will still be available.\n\n\nNote that our current implementation only queries RADB as BGPQ3 does not support the RIPE whois protocol.\n Our version will however set the RADB source database according to the member's stated IRRDB database as set on the customer add / edit page - so, for customer's registered with the RIPE IRRDB, the RIPE database of RADB is queried.",

Any other value will lead to a runtime exception.  we have currently defined three types which are used for grouping routers in the UI and for other selection purposes:  RC  - route collector;  RS  - route server;  AS112  - an AS112 BGP peer (see  INEX's AS112 documentation  as an example).  name  - name / description of the router's purpose.  shortname  - used in dropdowns or other space constrained areas where  name  may be too long.  router_id  - the router's BGP ID (e.g.  192.0.2.8 ).  peering_ip  - the IPv4/6 address that this router initiates BGP peering sessions from.  asn  - the router's AS number.  software  - there is no specific use for this as yet.  mgmt_ip  - the IP to address this server / router at for management functions such as Nagios monitoring.  api  and  api_type  - the API end point for this server/router. The only use case for this so far is for the built-in  looking glass  functionality via  Birdseye .  lg_access  - who should be allow access the looking glass. One of:  AUTH_PUBLIC  - publicly available to all;  AUTH_CUSTUSER  - must be logged into IXP Manager as any user;  AUTH_SUPERUSER  - must be logged into IXP Manager as an administrator (no customer access).  quarantine  - a flag to indicate if this router is part of the IXP's quarantine / test infrastructure. For example, INEX runs two parallel route collectors: one quarantine and one production. When customers have issues or are being provisioned, they are placed in the quarantine LAN and we can examine BGP announcements safely on the non-production quarantine devices. When a router is marked as quarantine, it is only visible in looking glass dropdowns to customers who also have a port in quarantine (physical interface status).  bgp_lc  - a flag to indicate if the router supports  RFC8092  /  large BGP communities .  template  - the template to use to generate the configuration. See stock examples  here  (and note that  skinning  is supported).   Typically your  routers.php  file would hold multiple such entries. It is our intention to move this into the UI and database.",

            "text": "The simplest configuration to generate is the route collector configuration. A route collector is an IXP router which serves only to  accept all routes and export no routes . It is used for problem diagnosis, to aid customer monitoring and for looking glasses (see  INEX's here .  The  standard configuration  simply pulls in a fairly standard header (sets up router ID, listening address and - for the collector at least - some unused filters) and creates a session for all customer routers on the given VLAN (see  vlan_id  above).  In the above example, the route handle is the array's associative key ( rc1-lan1-ipv4 ) and - for the given router handle - the configuration can be generated via:  # The key is generated in IXP Manager via the top right menu: *My Account -  API Keys*\nKEY= your-admin-ixp-manager-api-key \n# The base URL of your IXP Manager install plus: 'api/v4/router/gen_config'\nURL= https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/gen_config \n# The handle is the PHP associative key from `config/routers.php` as described above\nHANDLE= rc1-lan1-ipv4 \n# Then the complete URL is formed as:\ncurl --fail -s -H  X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: ${KEY}  ${URL}/${HANDLE}  ${HANDLE}.conf  Configurations for the route server and AS112 templates can be configured just as easily. The stock templates for both are secure and well tested and can be used by setting the  template  element of the router configuration above to the following:   AS112:  'api/v4/router/as112/bird/standard'  Route Server:  'api/v4/router/server/bird/standard'   We also provide sample scripts for automating the re-configuration of these services by cron. See the  -v4  scripts  in this directory . These are quite robust and have been in production for ~3 years at INEX (as of Jan 2017).",

            "text": "Normally on a peering exchange, all connected parties will establish bilateral peering relationships with each other customer connected to the exchange. As the number of connected parties increases, it becomes increasingly more difficult to manage peering relationships with customers of the exchange.  However, by using a route servers for peering relationships, the number of BGP sessions per router stays at two: one for each route server (assuming a resilient set up). Clearly this is a more sustainable way of maintaining IXP peering relationships with a large number of participants.  You will have learnt above how to automatically generate route server configurations. This section goes into a bit more specific detail on INEX's route server configuration (shipped with IXP Manager) and why it's safe to use.  The features of the route server configurations that we generate include:   full prefix filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required);  full origin ASN filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required);  in all cases, prefix filtering for IPv4 and v6 based on the IANA special purpose registries (also known as bogon lists);  ensuring next hop is the neighbor address to ensure no next hop hijacking;  max prefix limits;  multiple VLAN interfaces for a single member supported;  large BGP communities supported;  a decade of production use and experience.

Prerequisite:  you need to have set up some IRRDB sources (e.g. RIPE's whois service) under the  IXP Admin Actions / IRRDB Configuration  on the left hand side menu. There is a database seeder to install some to start you off via the following (but thius is typically done during installation):  ./artisan db:seed --class=IRRDBs  BGPQ3 is a very easy and fast way of querying IRRDBs. You first need to install this on your system. Then configure the path to it in  config/ixp_tools.php . If you have not used this file before, you'll need to create your own local copy as follows:  cp config/config/ixp_tools.php.dist config/config/ixp_tools.php  Then set the full call path for  bgpq3  in this file:  ?php\n\n  'irrdb' =  [\n        'bgpq' =  [\n            'path' =  '/path/to/bgpq3',\n        ],\n    ],  To populate (and update) your local IRRDB, run the following commands (changing the path as appropriate):  /srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-prefix-db\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-asn-db  These should be added to cron to run ~once per day (using the --quiet flag).  There are four levels of verbosity:   -quiet : no output unless there's an error / issue.  no option: simple stats on each customer's update results.  -vv : include per customer and overall timings (database, processing and network).  -vvv  (debug): show prefixes/ASNs added remove also.   You can also specify a specific customer to update (rather than all) with an additional free form parameter. The database is searched for a matching customer in the order: customer ASN; customer ID (database primary key); and customer shortname. E.g.:  /srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-prefix-db 64511  The IRRDB update commands will:   iterate over all route server client customers for IPv4 and IPv6 (unless a specific customer is specified);  use the appropriate AS macro or ASN;  query the RADB against the appropriate source set for that customer;  compare prefixes(/ASNs) in the database already (if any) against RADB and insert / delete as appropriate;  validate the prefix for proper CIDR notation before database inserts;  update the last_seen time for all prefixes(/ASNs) for that customer;   We use transactions to update the database so, even in the middle of a refresh, a full set of prefixes for all customers will still be available.  Note that our current implementation only queries RADB as BGPQ3 does not support the RIPE whois protocol.  Our version will however set the RADB source database according to the member's stated IRRDB database as set on the customer add / edit page - so, for customer's registered with the RIPE IRRDB, the RIPE database of RADB is queried.",

            "text": "Patch Panels / Cross Connects\n\n\nOne of the more difficult things for an IXP to manage is the sheer volume of patch panels / cross connects they need to manage. We have approached the issue a number of times in IXP Manger but abandoned the attempt every time. Typically our original solutions were over-engineered where all we really needed was something which could replace a spreadsheet per panel.\n\n\nWe believe we have now developed a feature complete and useful means of managing patch panels and associated cross connects.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nAdd / edit patch panels  (which includes cable and connector types).\n\n\nList associated patch panel ports which includes:\n\n\ntheir state (such as available / prewired, awaiting cross connect, connected, awaiting cease, reserved, broken).\n\n\nassociated customer and/or switchport.\n\n\nco-location provider's circuit reference.\n\n\ninternal ticket references.\n\n\nTransition ports from available / prewired to awaiting x-connect to connected to awaiting cease to ceased and then available again.\n\n\nCustomer view of their cross connects.\n\n\nPublic (visible to customers) and private notes per cross connect.\n\n\nAttach public and private files to cross connects (such as test results, completion documents, order forms, etc).\n\n\nMaintain complete history of a patch panel port.\n\n\nGenerate and email LoAs (as PDF) with a URL verification function for co-location providers.\n\n\nGenerate emails for connection and cease requests as well as an email providing full customer view of a cross connect.\n\n\nTypically fibre ports are \nduplex\n ports but there is a growing use of BiDi optics meaning simplex ports. Our implementation treats all ports as simplex but you can mark it as duplex and set its partner port.\n\n\n\n\nDuplex Fibre Ports\n\n\nWe suggest adding fibre ports as two ports per duplex port. I.e. if your patch panel has 12 duplex ports, enter this as 24 ports. When allocating ports later, you can set it as a duplex port and select its \npartner / slave port\n. This will future proof your patch panels for the growing use of bidi optics and other simplex based xWDM fibre solutions.\n\n\nFrom our experience, duplex fibre ports are often identified as their individual strands. For example, \nduplex port 5\n would be referenced as \nF9/F10\n.\n\n\nYour mileage may vary on this but we need to allow this flexibility to cover both use-cases. You always have options however:\n\n\n\n\nyou can change the presentation of how these ports are referenced externally by \nskinning\n the templates.\n\n\nyou have the option to edit emails before they are sent to also present this as you wish.\n\n\nyou can chose to treat duplex ports as single ports rather than doubling them up.\n\n\nwhen you have duplex ports on a patch panel, IXP Manager will provide a duplex view by default with a CSS-based toggle to reveal the typical partner ports.\n\n\nif you think IXP Manager can make this easier, please talk to us. \nBut we cannot cover every use case programatically. We've opted to allow flexibility rather than dictate a particular format.\n\n\n\n\nAdding a Patch Panel\n\n\nThe following image shows a typical \nadd a new patch panel\n form (as of v4.3). You'll note that clicking \nHelp\n provides detailed context aware help messages.\n\n\n\n\nMost of this is self-explanatory but:\n\n\n\n\nBy default, we set the \nColocation Reference\n to the \nPatch Panel Name\n. We are not sure it's a good idea for IXPs to create a second name different to the co-location provider's but this option is available to you. \nSeriously, think about what you are doing here - more references means more confusion!\n The cabinet and cable type is displayed in the list of patch panels so even with obscure data centre references, it should be easy to find what you need.\n\n\nLocation Notes\n: Data centre / co-location providers do a lot of weird, wonderful and strange things! They provide multiple references for a single patch panel (IXP cabinet, MMR, etc.), they get taken over and re-reference everything or even provide no discernable reference. The field is a freetext field that will be included (and parsed as Markdown) in all emails generated by IXP Manager to help you help them identify a patch panel!\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to that, we will also use a cabinets \nU's are counted from top/bottom\n, and a patch panel's \nU position\n and \nmounted at front/rear\n to also create a location description.\n\n When setting the \nNumber of Ports\n, ensure you count duplex fibre ports as \ntwo ports\n. So 12 duplex fibre ports would be entered as 24. When editing a patch panel, this input field represents the number of additional ports you want to add to a patch panel and thus defaults to 0 in that situation.\n\n \nPort Name Prefix\n: This is an optional field intended for use on fibre patch panels. As an example, you may wish to prefix individual fibre strands in a duplex port with F which would mean the name of a duplex port would be displayed as F1/F2.\n* \nChargeable\n: Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. Setting this only sets the default option when allocating ports to members later. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other.\n\n\nFiltering Patch Panel Ports\n\n\nQuite often, all you are looking for is a free in a particular location (data centre) or cabinet of a particular cable type (UTP / SMF / etc.).\n\n\nIXP Manager makes this easy from the \nPatch Panels\n page via the top right button labeled \nFilter Options\n. When clicked, this yields an advanced search as follows:\n\n\n\n\nCabinets auto-fills when you chose (or change) a location.\n\n\nPatch Panel Port States\n\n\nA patch panel port can have the following states:\n\n\n\n\nAvailable\n: The port is free and available for use.\n\n\nPrewired\n: This is equivalent to available but it means the port is prewired to a given switchport (you set the port when setting the prewired status). This is useful for IXPs that prewire a bunch of ports to avoid remote hands costs / data centre visits.\n\n\nAwaiting Xconnect\n: Port has been assigned to a member and we are awaiting the co-location provider to install the cross connect. In this state, context aware actions such as emailing connection requests, LoA generation and \nSet Connected\n are all available.\n\n\nConnected\n: Connected and in use.\n\n\nAwaiting Cease\n: This connection is no longer required and we are awaiting the end user / co-location provider to cease the connection.\n\n\nCeased\n: You will never see a ceased state. When a cross connect is marked as ceased, it's current state is archived (for history, include files) and the port is reset to \nAvailable\n. We do not revert to \nPrewired\n but an information message is shown to the user to hint this.\n\n\nReserved\n: Useful to mark particular ports as \noff limits\n for whatever reason.\n\n\nBroken\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\nFree / Available Ports\n\n\nIXP Manager will colour ports in the \nAvailable\n, \nPrewired\n and \nAwaiting Cease\n states are green allowing an easy visual indication of available ports.\n\n\nPatch Panel Port Lifecycle\n\n\nPatch panel ports start as either \navailable\n or \nprewired\n. The context menu in these states is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnset Prewired\n is available as this port has a \nPrewired\n status. Clicking this reverts it to plain \nAvailable\n and disassociates it from the prewired port.\n\n\nEdit Note...\n is always available and provides a pop up to edit public and private notes associated with the port (current lifecycle - ceased ports have their notes at that time archived and cleared).\n\n\n\n\nThe main lifecycle option here is \nAllocate\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n: A one line short description to be shown in the list of patch panel ports. Just enough to help explain the ports purpose. Detailed information should be placed in the notes section. Can also be used to explain a reserved / broken / other port. Note that this is parsed as Markdown.\n\n\n\n\nNB:\n A description is discouraged for customer ports connected to a switch. The customer name and switch port are the description.\n\n \nColocation Circuit Reference\n: this is the reference provided by the colocation provider to uniquely reference this cross connect.\n\n \nTicket Reference(s)\n: This is a free text field to be used by IXPs as they wish. The intended use is to enter helpdesk ticket references that relate to this cross connect order.\n\n \nDuplex connection?\n: Clicking this allows you to select the slave port for duplex connections.\n\n \nSwitch / Switch Port\n / \nCustomer\n: You have a number of options when allocating a port:\n  * If the port is pre-wired then the switch / switch port will be set here.\n  * If you chose a switch port which has been allocated to a customer, then this patch panel port will also be allocated to that customer. The backend logic will detect if this is the case and update the customer field.\n  * Conversely, if you chose a customer first, the switch / switch port dropdowns will be populated with only that customer's assigned ports.\n  * Sometimes you will get cross connects that are not intended to be connected to peering switches (e.g. connections to co-located customer equipment, IXP metro connections, etc.). In these cases, just select the customer (and if it's the IXP itself, select the IXP customer) and leave switch / switch port unselected.\n  * If you need to reset these fields, just click either of the Reset button.\n\n \nPatch Panel Port Status\n: when allocating a port, this will allow you to set the state to \nAwaiting Xconnect\n or \nConnected\n.\n\n \nPhysical Interface Status\n: this is not depicted above. If the selected switch port has already been assigned to a customer by way of a physical interface, you will have the option to update this here also.\n\n \nPublic\n and \nPrivate Notes\n: Public notes are available to the customer. Both fields are interpreted as Markdown.\n\n \nChargeable\n: Usually IXPs request their members to come to them and bear the costs of that. However, sometimes a co-location facility may charge the IXP for a half circuit or the IXP may need order and pay for the connection. The options are Yes / No / Half / Other. How individual IXPs use this is up to them.\n\n \nInternal Use\n: Marks the port as used by the IXP itself. E.g. metro connections.\n\n \nOwned By\n: Useful indication for billing and cease requests. Should represent the contractural owner of the cross connect. One of: Customer, IXP, Service Provider, Data Centre, Other. \nService Provider\n might be a metro provider where they ordered the cross connect.\n\n\nOnce a port is allocated, it enters the \nAwaiting XConnect\n / \nConnected\n state and there are additional context menu options available:\n\n\n\n\nThe three lifecycle actions are:\n\n\n\n\nSet Connected\n: updates the status (and allows you to add public/private notes). You next action after this should be \nEmail - Connect\n.\n\n\nSet Awaiting Cease\n: mark the port and pending disconnection. Your next action after this should be \nEmail - Cease\n.\n\n\nSet Ceased\n: this is a \ntransitive state\n in that it doesn't \nstick\n. When you mark a patch panel as ceased, the existing details (including files and notes) are archived as part of the port's history and then port is then cleared and made available again.\n\n\n\n\nFile Attachments\n\n\nOver the lifetime of a cross connect - and particularly when it is being ordered, there may be files exchanges between you and your customers or the colocation provider. These can be added to the patch panel port via the \nAttach File...\n option.\n\n\nThe dialog will dynamically determine the maximum file upload size based on your PHP settings. To alter this, change the following in your server's appropriate \nphp.ini\n:\n\n\n; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.\nupload_max_filesize = 40M\n\n; Must be greater than or equal to upload_max_filesize\npost_max_size = 40M\n\n\n\n\nPlease search the internet for further help as this is outside the scope of IXP Manager documentation.\n\n\nThe following features apply to file attachments:\n\n\n\n\nthey are archived along with the port history when a cross connect is ceased.\n\n\nthey are stored under \n$IXPROOT/storage/files/ppp\n.\n\n\ntwo files of the same name cannot be uploaded for a single patch panel port.\n\n\nthey can be marked as public or private:\n\n\npublic files are accessible to the customer through their own dashboard.\n\n\npublic files are attached to the \nEmail - Information\n email.\n\n\n\n\nLoA Generation\n\n\nMany co-location providers will not accept a cross connect order without a LoA \n(Letter of Agency/Authority)\n from the party to whom the cross connect is to be delivered (typically the IXP).\n\n\nIXP Manager will generate a PDF LoA to download or include in the emails it generates for you. Here is an example:\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to \nskin\n this yourself to change the legalese, address and contact details and potentially add a logo. See the version INEX uses \nhere\n (which includes and embedded PNG logo).\n\n\nNote that \nDompdf\n is used to turn the HTML template into a PDF and it has some restrictions.\n\n\nYou have two options for generating LoAs (without having IXP Manager email them):\n\n\n\n\nDownload PDF\n: downloads the PDF via your browser.\n\n\nView PDF\n: displays the PDF LoA in your browser (where browser supports it).\n\n\n\n\nLoA Verification\n\n\nThe stock LoA template (and INEX's version) includes a link that allows co-location browsers to click on to verify its veracity.\n\n\nOn successful verification, the end user sees:\n\n\n\n\nEmail Generation\n\n\nIXP Manager allows you to send four emails related to patch panels / cross connects (port status dependent). These are listed below. The Email editor looks as follows:\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\n\n\n\nthe option to attach a PDF LoA is a checkbox.\n\n\nthe email is written in Markdown with a preview available. The email is sent as both HTML (from the Markdown) and the plaintext version.\n\n\n\n\nThe four email templates available are:\n\n\n\n\nEmail - Connect\n: Email the customer a request to order a cross connect to the given demarcation points. A LoA is attached as a PDF by default unless you uncheck the box in the email editor.\n\n\nEmail - Cease\n: Email the customer a request to cease a cross connect.\n\n\nEmail - Information\n: Email the customer all details on file about a cross connect. We often get requests for this at INEX and this simplifies the process. The generated email includes:\n\n\nthe standard details regarding port and co-location reference;\n\n\npublic notes;\n\n\npublic files as attachments.\n\n\nEmail - LoA\n: Email a LoA to the customer as attached as a PDF. This is similar to \nEmail - Connect\n but it is more reflective of a typical response to a second request for a LoA.\n\n\n\n\nAll email templates can be \nskinned\n for your own needs. See INEX's example skins \nhere\n.\n\n\nViewing Patch Panel Details and Archives\n\n\nEach patch panel port row has the following button:\n\n\n\n\nThe number in the badge indicates how many historical records are available.\n\n\nClicking on the button yields the following view screen:\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment History\n\n\nThe Patch Panels functionality was developed during Q1 2017 and added in March 2017.

When allocating ports later, you can set it as a duplex port and select its  partner / slave port . This will future proof your patch panels for the growing use of bidi optics and other simplex based xWDM fibre solutions.  From our experience, duplex fibre ports are often identified as their individual strands. For example,  duplex port 5  would be referenced as  F9/F10 .  Your mileage may vary on this but we need to allow this flexibility to cover both use-cases. You always have options however:   you can change the presentation of how these ports are referenced externally by  skinning  the templates.  you have the option to edit emails before they are sent to also present this as you wish.  you can chose to treat duplex ports as single ports rather than doubling them up.  when you have duplex ports on a patch panel, IXP Manager will provide a duplex view by default with a CSS-based toggle to reveal the typical partner ports.  if you think IXP Manager can make this easier, please talk to us.

How this is done has been changed significantly from v3 to v4.\n\n\n\n\nNote that until officially deprecated, the older v3 methods still work and the \nofficial v3 documentation\n should be referenced for that.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration Overview\n\n\nThe basic elements of \na router\n are configured in \nconfigs/routers.php\n. This is an optional file that is not included in version control so the best way to start it is to copy from the template:\n\n\ncp config/routers.php.dist config/routers.php\n\n\n\n\nA typical entry of a sample router (in standard PHP associative array syntax) is:\n\n\n?php\n    'rc1-lan1-ipv4' =\n [\n        'vlan_id'    =\n 1,\n        'protocol'   =\n 4,\n        'type'       =\n 'RC',   // RC|RS|AS112?\n        'name'       =\n 'INEX LAN1 - Route Collector - IPv4',\n        'shortname'  =\n 'RC1 - LAN1 - IPv4',\n        'router_id'  =\n '192.0.2.8',\n        'peering_ip' =\n '192.0.2.8',\n        'asn'        =\n 65500,\n        'software'   =\n 'bird',\n        'mgmt_ip'    =\n '203.0.113.8',\n        'api'        =\n 'http://rc1-lan1-ipv4.mgmt.example.com/api',\n        'api_type'   =\n 'birdseye',\n        'lg_access'  =\n Entities\\User::AUTH_PUBLIC,\n        'quarantine' =\n false,\n        'bgp_lc'     =\n false,\n        'template'   =\n 'api/v4/router/collector/bird/standard',\n    ],\n\n\n\n\nwhere:\n\n\n\n\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n is the \nhandle\n for this router to be used in API calls later (it's the key of the PHP associative array).\n\n\nvlan_id\n is not the VLAN 802.1q tag number but the \nvlan.id\n database column. You can get this, for example, by hovering over the edit action in the VLAN listing in IXP Manager and finding the number in the URL.\n\n\nprotocol\n is either \n4\n (IPv4) or \n6\n (IPv6). Any other value will lead to a runtime exception.\n\n\nwe have currently defined three types which are used for grouping routers in the UI and for other selection purposes:\n\n\nRC\n - route collector;\n\n\nRS\n - route server;\n\n\nAS112\n - an AS112 BGP peer (see \nINEX's AS112 documentation\n as an example).\n\n\nname\n - name / description of the router's purpose.\n\n\nshortname\n - used in dropdowns or other space constrained areas where \nname\n may be too long.\n\n\nrouter_id\n - the router's BGP ID (e.g. \n192.0.2.8\n).\n\n\npeering_ip\n - the IPv4/6 address that this router initiates BGP peering sessions from.\n\n\nasn\n - the router's AS number.\n\n\nsoftware\n - there is no specific use for this as yet.\n\n\nmgmt_ip\n - the IP to address this server / router at for management functions such as Nagios monitoring.\n\n\napi\n and \napi_type\n - the API end point for this server/router. The only use case for this so far is for the built-in \nlooking glass\n functionality via \nBirdseye\n.\n\n\nlg_access\n - who should be allow access the looking glass. One of:\n\n\nAUTH_PUBLIC\n - publicly available to all;\n\n\nAUTH_CUSTUSER\n - must be logged into IXP Manager as any user;\n\n\nAUTH_SUPERUSER\n - must be logged into IXP Manager as an administrator (no customer access).\n\n\nquarantine\n - a flag to indicate if this router is part of the IXP's quarantine / test infrastructure. For example, INEX runs two parallel route collectors: one quarantine and one production. When customers have issues or are being provisioned, they are placed in the quarantine LAN and we can examine BGP announcements safely on the non-production quarantine devices. When a router is marked as quarantine, it is only visible in looking glass dropdowns to customers who also have a port in quarantine (physical interface status).\n\n\nbgp_lc\n - a flag to indicate if the router supports \nRFC8092\n / \nlarge BGP communities\n.\n\n\ntemplate\n - the template to use to generate the configuration. See stock examples \nhere\n (and note that \nskinning\n is supported).\n\n\n\n\nTypically your \nrouters.php\n file would hold multiple such entries. It is our intention to move this into the UI and database.\n\n\nGeneration Overview\n\n\nThe simplest configuration to generate is the route collector configuration. A route collector is an IXP router which serves only to \naccept all routes and export no routes\n. It is used for problem diagnosis, to aid customer monitoring and for looking glasses (see \nINEX's here\n.\n\n\nThe \nstandard configuration\n simply pulls in a fairly standard header (sets up router ID, listening address and - for the collector at least - some unused filters) and creates a session for all customer routers on the given VLAN (see \nvlan_id\n above).\n\n\nIn the above example, the route handle is the array's associative key (\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n) and - for the given router handle - the configuration can be generated via:\n\n\n# The key is generated in IXP Manager via the top right menu: *My Account -\n API Keys*\nKEY=\nyour-admin-ixp-manager-api-key\n\n# The base URL of your IXP Manager install plus: 'api/v4/router/gen_config'\nURL=\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/gen_config\n\n# The handle is the PHP associative key from `config/routers.php` as described above\nHANDLE=\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n\n# Then the complete URL is formed as:\ncurl --fail -s -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: ${KEY}\n ${URL}/${HANDLE} \n${HANDLE}.conf\n\n\n\n\nConfigurations for the route server and AS112 templates can be configured just as easily. The stock templates for both are secure and well tested and can be used by setting the \ntemplate\n element of the router configuration above to the following:\n\n\n\n\nAS112: \n'api/v4/router/as112/bird/standard'\n\n\nRoute Server: \n'api/v4/router/server/bird/standard'\n\n\n\n\nWe also provide sample scripts for automating the re-configuration of these services by cron. See the \n-v4\n scripts \nin this directory\n. These are quite robust and have been in production for ~3 years at INEX (as of Jan 2017).\n\n\nRoute Servers\n\n\nNormally on a peering exchange, all connected parties will establish bilateral peering relationships with each other customer connected to the exchange. As the number of connected parties increases, it becomes increasingly more difficult to manage peering relationships with customers of the exchange.\n\n\nHowever, by using a route servers for peering relationships, the number of BGP sessions per router stays at two: one for each route server (assuming a resilient set up). Clearly this is a more sustainable way of maintaining IXP peering relationships with a large number of participants.\n\n\nYou will have learnt above how to automatically generate route server configurations. This section goes into a bit more specific detail on INEX's route server configuration (shipped with IXP Manager) and why it's safe to use.\n\n\nThe features of the route server configurations that we generate include:\n\n\n\n\nfull prefix filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required);\n\n\nfull origin ASN filtering based on IRRDB entries (can be disabled on a per member basis if required);\n\n\nin all cases, prefix filtering for IPv4 and v6 based on the IANA special purpose registries (also known as bogon lists);\n\n\nensuring next hop is the neighbor address to ensure no next hop hijacking;\n\n\nmax prefix limits;\n\n\nmultiple VLAN interfaces for a single member supported;\n\n\nlarge BGP communities supported;\n\n\na decade of production use and experience.\n\n\n\n\nThere are \nsome old notes on route server testing here\n which may also be useful.\n\n\nIRRDB Prefixes and ASN Filtering\n\n\nIXP Manager can maintain a list of member route:/route6: prefixes and origin ASNs as registered in IRRDBs in its database and then use these to, for example, generate strict inbound filters on route servers.\n\n\nPrerequisite:\n you need to have set up some IRRDB sources (e.g. RIPE's whois service) under the \nIXP Admin Actions / IRRDB Configuration\n on the left hand side menu. There is a database seeder to install some to start you off via the following (but thius is typically done during installation):\n\n\n./artisan db:seed --class=IRRDBs\n\n\n\n\nBGPQ3 is a very easy and fast way of querying IRRDBs. You first need to install this on your system. Then configure the path to it in \nconfig/ixp_tools.php\n. If you have not used this file before, you'll need to create your own local copy as follows:\n\n\ncp config/config/ixp_tools.php.dist config/config/ixp_tools.php\n\n\n\n\nThen set the full call path for \nbgpq3\n in this file:\n\n\n?php\n\n  'irrdb' =\n [\n        'bgpq' =\n [\n            'path' =\n '/path/to/bgpq3',\n        ],\n    ],\n\n\n\n\nTo populate (and update) your local IRRDB, run the following commands (changing the path as appropriate):\n\n\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-prefix-db\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-asn-db\n\n\n\n\nThese should be added to cron to run ~once per day (using the --quiet flag).\n\n\nThere are four levels of verbosity:\n\n\n\n\n-quiet\n: no output unless there's an error / issue.\n\n\nno option: simple stats on each customer's update results.\n\n\n-vv\n: include per customer and overall timings (database, processing and network).\n\n\n-vvv\n (debug): show prefixes/ASNs added remove also.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also specify a specific customer to update (rather than all) with an additional free form parameter. The database is searched for a matching customer in the order: customer ASN; customer ID (database primary key); and customer shortname. E.g.:\n\n\n/srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-prefix-db 64511\n\n\n\n\nThe IRRDB update commands will:\n\n\n\n\niterate over all route server client customers for IPv4 and IPv6 (unless a specific customer is specified);\n\n\nuse the appropriate AS macro or ASN;\n\n\nquery the RADB against the appropriate source set for that customer;\n\n\ncompare prefixes(/ASNs) in the database already (if any) against RADB and insert / delete as appropriate;\n\n\nvalidate the prefix for proper CIDR notation before database inserts;\n\n\nupdate the last_seen time for all prefixes(/ASNs) for that customer;\n\n\n\n\nWe use transactions to update the database so, even in the middle of a refresh, a full set of prefixes for all customers will still be available.\n\n\nNote that our current implementation only queries RADB as BGPQ3 does not support the RIPE whois protocol.\n Our version will however set the RADB source database according to the member's stated IRRDB database as set on the customer add / edit page - so, for customer's registered with the RIPE IRRDB, the RIPE database of RADB is queried.",

In the above example, the route handle is the array's associative key ( rc1-lan1-ipv4 ) and - for the given router handle - the configuration can be generated via:  # The key is generated in IXP Manager via the top right menu: *My Account -  API Keys*\nKEY= your-admin-ixp-manager-api-key \n# The base URL of your IXP Manager install plus: 'api/v4/router/gen_config'\nURL= https://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/gen_config \n# The handle is the PHP associative key from `config/routers.php` as described above\nHANDLE= rc1-lan1-ipv4 \n# Then the complete URL is formed as:\ncurl --fail -s -H  X-IXP-Manager-API-Key: ${KEY}  ${URL}/${HANDLE}  ${HANDLE}.conf  Configurations for the route server and AS112 templates can be configured just as easily. The stock templates for both are secure and well tested and can be used by setting the  template  element of the router configuration above to the following:   AS112:  'api/v4/router/as112/bird/standard'  Route Server:  'api/v4/router/server/bird/standard'   We also provide sample scripts for automating the re-configuration of these services by cron.

A route collector is an IXP router which serves only to \naccept all routes and export no routes\n. It is used for problem diagnosis, to aid customer monitoring and for looking glasses (see \nINEX's here\n.\n\n\nThe \nstandard configuration\n simply pulls in a fairly standard header (sets up router ID, listening address and - for the collector at least - some unused filters) and creates a session for all customer routers on the given VLAN (see \nvlan_id\n above).\n\n\nIn the above example, the route handle is the array's associative key (\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n) and - for the given router handle - the configuration can be generated via:\n\n\n# The key is generated in IXP Manager via the top right menu: *My Account -\n API Keys*\nKEY=\nyour-admin-ixp-manager-api-key\n\n# The base URL of your IXP Manager install plus: 'api/v4/router/gen_config'\nURL=\nhttps://ixp.example.com/api/v4/router/gen_config\n\n# The handle is the PHP associative key from `config/routers.php` as described above\nHANDLE=\nrc1-lan1-ipv4\n\n# Then the complete URL is formed as:\ncurl --fail -s -H \nX-IXP-Manager-API-Key: ${KEY}\n ${URL}/${HANDLE} \n${HANDLE}.conf\n\n\n\n\nConfigurations for the route server and AS112 templates can be configured just as easily. The stock templates for both are secure and well tested and can be used by setting the \ntemplate\n element of the router configuration above to the following:\n\n\n\n\nAS112: \n'api/v4/router/as112/bird/standard'\n\n\nRoute Server: \n'api/v4/router/server/bird/standard'\n\n\n\n\nWe also provide sample scripts for automating the re-configuration of these services by cron.

The database is searched for a matching customer in the order: customer ASN; customer ID (database primary key); and customer shortname. E.g.:  /srv/ixpmanager/artisan irrdb:update-prefix-db 64511  The IRRDB update commands will:   iterate over all route server client customers for IPv4 and IPv6 (unless a specific customer is specified);  use the appropriate AS macro or ASN;  query the RADB against the appropriate source set for that customer;  compare prefixes(/ASNs) in the database already (if any) against RADB and insert / delete as appropriate;  validate the prefix for proper CIDR notation before database inserts;  update the last_seen time for all prefixes(/ASNs) for that customer;   We use transactions to update the database so, even in the middle of a refresh, a full set of prefixes for all customers will still be available.  Note that our current implementation only queries RADB as BGPQ3 does not support the RIPE whois protocol.  Our version will however set the RADB source database according to the member's stated IRRDB database as set on the customer add / edit page - so, for customer's registered with the RIPE IRRDB, the RIPE database of RADB is queried.",

As such, how to skin a page will depend on whether the template is found in \nresources/views\n (v4) or \napplication/[modules/xxx/]views\n (v3). Both are covered here.\n\n\n\n\nIXP Manager\n supports template/view skinning allowing users to substitute any of their own templates in place of the default ones shipped with IXP Manager.\n\n\nSkinning in Version 4+\n\n\nFirst, set the following parameter in \n.env\n:\n\n\nVIEW_SKIN=\nexample\n\n\n\n\n\nSkins should then be placed in the \nresources/skins/example\n directory (\nexample\n should be substituted for whatever you want to call your own skin). The default templates can be found in \nresources/views\n directory. INEX bundles its own skinned templates in \nresources/skins/inex\n as an example.\n\n\nOnce a skin is enabled from \n.env\n, then any templates found in the skin directory \n(using the same directory structure as found under \nresouces/views\n)\n will take precedence over the default template file. This means you do not need to recreate / copy all the default files - just replace the ones you want.\n\n\nIn previous versions of \nIXP Manager\n, we used Smarty as the templating engine. This meant that if someone wanted to help improve \nIXP Manager\n then they would need to become familiar with PHP \nand\n Smarty. In v4 we dropped Smarty and, rather than using another compiled templating engine, we have decided to go with native PHP templates.\n\n\nFor this, we are using \nFoil\n - \nFoil brings all the flexibility and power of modern template engines to native PHP templates. Write simple, clean and concise templates with nothing more than PHP.\n Also, simulaneously supported are Lavael's own \nBlade templates\n which we sometimes use for simple pages.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nThe \ngraphing\n MRTG configuration generator allows for custom configuration content at the top and bottom of the file. In order to have your custom configuration enabled, you need to skin two files.\n\n\nHere's an example:\n\n\n# position ourselves in the IXP Manager root directory\ncd /path/to/ixp4\n\n# make the skin directory\nmkdir resources/skins/example\n\n# create the full path required for the MRTG configuration files:\nmkdir -p resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg\n\n# copy over the customisation files:\ncp views/services/grapher/mrtg/custom-header.foil.php resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg\ncp views/services/grapher/mrtg/custom-footer.foil.php resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg\n\n# edit the above files as required\nvi resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg/custom-header.plates.php\nvi resources/skins/example/services/grapher/mrtg/custom-footer.plates.php\n\n\n\n\nThen, finally, edit \n.env\n and set the skin to use:\n\n\nVIEW_SKINS=\nexample\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can of course skin any file including the non-custom MRTG files as suits your needs.\n\n\nCustom Variables / Configuration Options\n\n\nWhen you are skinning your own templates, you may find you need to create custom configuration options for values you do not want to store directly in your own templates. For this, we have a configuration file which is excluded from Git. Initiate it via::\n\n\ncp config/custom.php.dist config/custom.php\n\n\n\n\nThis is \nLaravel's standard configuration file format\n (which is an associative PHP array). You can also use Laravel's dotenv variables here too.\n\n\nAs an example, if you were to create a configuration option:\n\n\n?php\n'example' =\n [\n    'key' =\n 'my own config value',\n],\n\n\n\n\nthen in code this would be accessible as:\n\n\n?php\nconfig( \ncustom.example.key\n, \ndefault value if not set|null\n )\n\n\n\n\nwhere the second parameter is a default option if the requested configuration setting has not been defined (which defaults to \nnull\n). In templates, this can be accessed the same way or rendered in the template with::\n\n\n?= config( \ncustom.example.key\n, \ndefault\n ) ?\n\n\n\n\n\nSkinning Old Templates\n\n\nThis is still important as \nIXP Manager\n v4 still uses most of the previous templates.\n\n\nTo skin files found under \napplication/[modules/xxx/]views\n, proceed as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nset a skin name in \n.env\n:\n   \nVIEW_SMARTY_SKIN=\"myskin\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncreate a directory with a matching name: \napplication/views/_skins/myskin\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the above \n.env\n option is set, then any pages in its skin directory (using the same directory structure as \napplication/views\n will take precedence over the default template files.
